<h4>THE RELAY-RACE</h4>


<p>The shining blue waters of two wonderful gulfs were
busy with fishing boats and little ships. The vessels
came under their square sails and were driven by galley-slaves
with great oars.</p>

<p>A Greek boy standing, two thousand years ago, on
the wonderful mountain of the Acro-Corinth that
leaps suddenly from the plain above Corinth to a pinnacle
over a thousand feet high, could see the boats
come sailing from the east, where they hailed from the
Pir&aelig;us and Ephesus and the marble islands of the
&AElig;gean Sea. Turning round he could watch them also
coming from the West up the Gulf of Corinth from the
harbours of the Gulf and even from the Adriatic Sea
and Brundusium.</p>

<p>In between the two gulfs lay the Isthmus of Corinth
to which the men on the ships were sailing and rowing.</p>

<p>The people were all in holiday dress for the great
athletic sports were to be held on that day and the
next,&mdash;the sports that drew, in those ancient days, over
thirty thousand Greeks from all the country round;
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>from the towns on the shores of the two gulfs and
from the mountain-lands of Greece,&mdash;from Parnassus
and Helicon and Delphi, from Athens and the villages
on the slopes of Hymettus and even from Sparta.</p>

<p>These sports, which were some of the finest ever held
in the whole world, were called&mdash;because they were
held on this isthmus&mdash;the Isthmian Games.</p>

<p>The athletes wrestled. They boxed with iron-studded
leather straps over their knuckles. They fought
lions brought across the Mediterranean (the Great Sea
as they called it) from Africa, and tigers carried up
the Khyber Pass across Persia from India. They flung
spears, threw quoits and ran foot-races. Amid the wild
cheering of thirty thousand throats the charioteers
drove their frenzied horses, lathered with foam,
around the roaring stadium.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful of these races has a
strange hold on the imagination. It was a relay-race.
This is how it was run.</p>

<p>Men bearing torches stood in a line at the starting
point. Each man belonged to a separate team. Away
in the distance stood another row of men waiting.
Each of these was the comrade of one of those men
at the starting point. Farther on still, out of sight,
stood another row and then another and another.</p>

<p>At the word "Go" the men at the starting point leapt
forward, their torches burning. They ran at top speed
towards the waiting men and then gasping for breath,
each passed his torch to his comrade in the next row.
He, in turn, seizing the flaming torch, leapt forward
and dashed along the course toward the next relay,
who again raced on and on till at last one man dashed
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>past the winning post with his torch burning ahead
of all the others, amid the applauding cheers of the
multitude.</p>

<p>The Greeks, who were very fond of this race, coined
a proverbial phrase from it. Translated it runs:</p>

<p>"Let the torch-bearers hand on the flame to the
others" or "Let those who have the light pass it on."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That relay-race of torch-bearers is a living picture
of the wonderful relay-race of heroes who, right
through the centuries, have, with dauntless courage and
a scorn of danger and difficulty, passed through thrilling
adventures in order to carry the Light across the
continents and oceans of the world.</p>

<p>The torch-bearers! The long race of those who
have borne, and still carry the torches, passing them
on from hand to hand, runs before us. A little ship
puts out from Seleucia, bearing a man who had caught
the fire in a blinding blaze of light on the road to
Damascus. Paul crosses the sea and then threads his
way through the cities of Cyprus and Asia Minor,
passes over the blue &AElig;gean to answer the call from
Macedonia. We see the light quicken, flicker and
glow to a steady blaze in centre after centre of life,
till at last the torch-bearer reaches his goal in Rome.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Yes, without cheer of sister or of daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yes, without stay of father or of son,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lone on the land and homeless on the water<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Pass I in patience till the work be done."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Centuries pass and men of another age, taking the
light that Paul had brought, carry the torch over Ap<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>ennine
and Alp, through dense forests where wild
beasts and wilder savages roam, till they cross the
North Sea and the light reaches the fair-haired Angles
of Britain, on whose name Augustine had exercised
his punning humour, when he said, "Not Angles, but
Angels." From North and South, through Columba
and Aidan, Wilfred of Sussex and Bertha of Kent, the
light came to Britain.</p>

<p>"Is not our life," said the aged seer to the Mercian
heathen king as the Missionary waited for permission
to lead them to Christ, "like a sparrow that flies from
the darkness through the open window into this hall
and flutters about in the torchlight for a few moments
to fly out again into the darkness of the night. Even
so we know not whence our life comes nor whither it
goes. This man can tell us. Shall we not receive his
teaching?" So the English, through these torch-bearers,
come into the light.</p>

<p>The centuries pass by and in 1620 the little <i>Mayflower</i>,
bearing Christian descendants of those heathen
Angles&mdash;new torch-bearers, struggles through frightful
tempests to plant on the American Continent the
New England that was indeed to become the forerunner
of a New World.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A century and a half passes and down the estuary of
the Thames creeps another sailing ship.</p>

<p>The Government officer shouts his challenge:</p>

<p>"What ship is that and what is her cargo?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Duff</i>," rings back the answer, "under Captain
Wilson, bearing Missionaries to the South Sea."</p>

<p><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>The puzzled official has never heard of such beings!
But the little ship passes on and after adventures and
tempests in many seas at last reaches the far Pacific.
There the torch-bearers pass from island to island
and the light flames like a beacon fire across many a
blue lagoon and coral reef.</p>

<p>One after another the great heroes sail out across
strange seas and penetrate hidden continents each with
a torch in his hand.</p>

<p>Livingstone, the lion-hearted pathfinder in Africa,
goes out as the fearless explorer, the dauntless and resourceful
missionary, faced by poisoned arrows and the
guns of Arabs and marched with only his black companions
for thousands of miles through marsh and forest,
over mountain pass and across river swamps, in
loneliness and hunger, often with bleeding feet, on and
on to the little hut in old Chitambo's village in Ilala,
where he crossed the river. Livingstone is the Coeur-de-Lion
of our Great Crusade.</p>

<p>John Williams, who, in his own words, could "never
be content with the limits of a single reef," built with
his own hands and almost without any tools on a cannibal
island the wonderful little ship <i>The Messenger of
Peace</i> in which he sailed many thousands of miles from
island to island across the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>These are only two examples of the men whose adventures
are more thrilling than those of our story
books and yet are absolutely true, and we find them in
every country and in each of the centuries.</p>

<p>So&mdash;as we look across the ages we</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"See the race of hero-spirits<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pass the torch from hand to hand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>In this book the stories of a few of them are told as
yarns to boys and girls round a camp-fire. Every one
of the tales is historically true, and is accurate in detail.</p>

<p>In that ancient Greek relay-race the prize to each
winner was simply a wreath of leaves cut by a priest
with a golden knife from trees in the sacred grove near
the Sea,&mdash;the grove where the Temple of Neptune, the
god of the Ocean, stood. It was just a crown of wild
olive that would wither away. Yet no man would have
changed it for its weight in gold.</p>

<p>For when the proud winner in the race went back
to his little city, set among the hills, with his already
withering wreath, all the people would come and hail
him a victor and wave ribbons in the air. A great
sculptor would carve a statue of him in imperishable
marble and it would be set up in the city. And on the
head of the statue of the young athlete was carved a
wreath.</p>

<p>In the great relay-race of the world many athletes&mdash;men
and women&mdash;have won great fame by the speed
and skill and daring with which they carried forward
the torch and, themselves dropping in their tracks, have
passed the flame on to the next runner; Paul, Francis,
Penn, Livingstone, Mackay, Florence Nightingale, and
a host of others. And many who have run just as
bravely and swiftly have won no fame at all though
their work was just as great. But the fame or the
forgetting really does not matter. The fact is that the
race is still running; <i>it has not yet been won</i>. Whose
team will win? That is what matters.</p>

<p><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>The world is the stadium. Teams of evil run rapidly
and teams of good too.</p>

<p>The great heroes and heroines whose story is told
in this book have run across the centuries over the
world to us. Some of them are alive to-day, as heroic
as those who have gone. But all of them say the
same thing to us of the new world who are coming
after them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Take the torch."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The greatest of them all, when he came to the very
end of his days, as he fell and passed on the Torch
to others, said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I have run my course."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But to us who are coming on as Torch-bearers after
him he spoke in urgent words&mdash;written to the people
at Corinth where the Isthmian races were run:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Do you not know that they which run<br /></span>
<span class="i2">in a race all run, but one wins the prize?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So run, that ye may be victors."<br /></span>

<h4>THE HERO OF THE LONG TRAIL</h4>

<h4><i>St. Paul</i></h4>

<p class='center'>(Dates, b. A.D. 6, d. A.D. 67<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>)</p>


<p><i>The Three Comrades.</i></p>

<p>The purple shadows of three men moved ahead of
them on the tawny stones of the Roman road on the
high plateau of Asia Minor one bright, fresh morning.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
They had just come out under the arched gateway
through the thick walls of the Roman city of Antioch-in-Pisidia.
The great aqueduct of stone that brought
the water to the city from the mountains on their
right<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> looked like a string of giant camels turned to
stone.</p>

<p>Of the three men, one was little more than a boy.
He had the oval face of his Greek father and the
glossy dark hair of his Jewish mother. The older men,
whose long tunics were caught up under their girdles to
give their legs free play in walking, were brown, grizzled,
sturdy travellers. They had walked a hundred
leagues together from the hot plains of Syria, through
the snow-swept passes of the Taurus mountains, and
over the sun-scorched levels of the high plateau.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Their
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>muscles were as tireless as whipcord. Their courage
had not quailed before robber or blizzard, the night
yells of the hyena or the stones of angry mobs.</p>

<p>For the youth this was his first adventure out into
the glorious, unknown world. He was on the open
road with the glow of the sun on his cheek and the
sting of the breeze in his face; a strong staff in his
hand; with his wallet stuffed with food&mdash;cheese, olives,
and some flat slabs of bread; and by his side his own
great hero, Paul. Their sandals rang on the stone pavement
of the road which ran straight as a strung bowline
from the city, Antioch-in-Pisidia, away to the
west. The boy carried over his shoulder the cloak of
Paul, and carried that cloak as though it had been the
royal purple garment of the Roman Emperor himself
instead of the worn, faded, travel-stained cloak of a
wandering tent-maker.</p>

<p>The two older men, whose names were Paul the
Tarsian and Silas, had trudged six hundred miles.
Their younger companion, whose name was "Fear
God," or Timothy as we say, with his Greek fondness
for perfect athletic fitness of the body, proudly felt the
taut, wiry muscles working under his skin.</p>

<p>On they walked for day after day, from dawn when
the sun rose behind them to the hour when the sun
glowed over the hills in their faces. They turned
northwest and at last dropped down from the highlands
of this plateau of Asia Minor, through a long broad
valley, until they looked down across the Plain of Troy
to the bluest sea in the world.</p>

<p><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>Timothy's eyes opened with astonishment as he
looked down on such a city as he had never seen&mdash;the
great Roman seaport of Troy. The marble Stadium,
where the chariots raced and the gladiators fought,
gleamed in the afternoon light.</p>

<p>The three companions could not stop long to gaze.
They swung easily down the hill-sides and across the
plain into Troy, where they took lodgings.</p>

<p>They had not been in Troy long when they met a
doctor named Luke. We do not know whether one of
them was ill and the doctor helped him; we do not
know whether Doctor Luke (who was a Greek) worshipped,
when he met them, &AElig;sculapius, the god of
healing of the Greek people. The doctor did not live
in Troy, but was himself a visitor.</p>

<p>"I live across the sea," Luke told his three friends&mdash;Paul,
Silas and Timothy&mdash;stretching his hand out
towards the north. "I live," he would say proudly, "in
the greatest city of all Macedonia&mdash;Philippi. It is
called after the great ruler Philip of Macedonia."</p>

<p>Then Paul in his turn would be sure to tell Doctor
Luke what it was that had brought him across a thousand
miles of plain and mountain pass, hill and valley,
to Troy. This is how he would tell the story in such
words as he used again and again:</p>

<p>"I used to think," he said, "that I ought to do many
things to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. I had
many of His disciples put into prison and even voted
for their being put to death. I became so exceedingly
mad against them that I even pursued them to foreign
cities.</p>

<p><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>"Then as I was journeying<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to Damascus, with the
authority of the chief priests themselves, at mid-day
I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than
the blaze of the sun, shining round about me and my
companions. And, as we were all fallen on to the road,
I heard a voice saying to me:</p>

<p>"'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard
for you to kick against the goad.'</p>

<p>"And I said, 'Who are you, Lord?'</p>

<p>"The answer came: 'I am Jesus, whom you persecute.'"</p>

<p>Then Paul went on:</p>

<p>"I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision; but
I told those in Damascus and in Jerusalem and in all
Jud&aelig;a, aye! and the foreign nations also, that they
should repent and turn to God.</p>

<p>"Later on," said Paul, "I fell into a trance, and Jesus
came again to me and said, 'Go, I will send you afar to
the Nations.' That (Paul would say to Luke) is why I
walk among perils in the city; in perils in the wilderness;
in perils in the sea; in labour and work; in
hunger and thirst and cold, to tell people everywhere
of the love of God shown in Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>


<p><i>The Call to Cross the Sea.</i></p>

<p>One night, after one of these talks, as Paul was asleep
in Troy, he seemed to see a figure standing by him.
Surely it was the dream-figure of Luke, the doctor
from Macedonia, holding out his hands and pleading
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>with Paul, saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help
us."</p>

<p>Now neither Paul nor Silas nor Timothy had ever
been across the sea into the land that we now call
Europe. But in the morning, when Paul told his companions
about the dream that he had had, they all
agreed that God had called them to go and deliver the
good news of the Kingdom to the people in Luke's city
of Philippi and in the other cities of Macedonia.</p>

<p>So they went down into the busy harbour of Troy,
where the singing sailor-men were bumping bales of
goods from the backs of camels into the holds of the
ships, and they took a passage in a little coasting ship.
She hove anchor and was rowed out through the entrance
between the ends of the granite piers of the
harbour. The seamen hoisting the sails, the little ship
went gaily out into the &AElig;gean Sea.</p>

<p>All day they ran before the breeze and at night anchored
under the lee of an island. At dawn they sailed
northward again with a good wind, till they saw land.
Behind the coast on high ground the columns of a temple
glowed in the sunlight. They ran into a spacious
bay and anchored in the harbour of a new city&mdash;Neapolis
as it was called&mdash;the port of Philippi.</p>

<p>Landing from the little ship, Paul, Silas, Timothy
and Luke climbed from the harbour by a glen to the
crest of the hill, and then on, for three or four hours
of hard walking, till their sandals rang on the pavement
under the marble arch of the gate through the
wall of Philippi.</p>

<p><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><i>Flogging and Prison.</i></p>

<p>As Paul and his friends walked about in the city
they talked with people; for instance, with a woman
called Lydia, who also had come across the sea from
Asia Minor where she was born. She and her children
and slaves all became Christians. So the men and
women of Philippi soon began to talk about these
strange teachers from the East. One day Paul and
Silas met a slave girl dressed in a flowing, coloured
tunic. She was a fortune-teller, who earned money for
her masters by looking at people and trying to see at
a glance what they were like so that she might tell their
fortunes. The fortune-telling girl saw Paul and Silas
going along, and she stopped and called out loud so
that everyone who went by might hear: "These men
are the slaves of the Most High God. They tell you
the way of Salvation."</p>

<p>The people stood and gaped with astonishment, and
still the girl called out the same thing, until a crowd
began to come round. Then Paul turned round and
with sternness in his voice spoke to the evil spirit in
the girl and said: "In the Name of Jesus Christ, I order
you out of her."</p>

<p>From that day the girl lost her power to tell people's
fortunes, so that the money that used to come to
her masters stopped flowing. They were very angry
and stirred up everybody to attack Paul and Silas. A
mob collected and searched through the streets until
they found them. Then they clutched hold of their
arms and robes, shouting: "To the pr&aelig;tors! To the
pr&aelig;tors!" The pr&aelig;tors were great officials who sat
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>in marble chairs in the Forum, the central square of
the city.</p>

<p>The masters of the slave girl dragged Paul and Silas
along. At their heels came the shouting mob and when
they came in front of the pr&aelig;tors, the men cried out:</p>

<p>"See these fellows! Jews as they are, they are upsetting
everything in the city. They tell people to take
up customs that are against the Law for us as Romans
to accept."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" yelled the crowd. "Flog them! Flog
them!"</p>

<p>The pr&aelig;tors, without asking Paul or Silas a single
question as to whether this was true, or allowing them
to make any defence, were fussily eager to show their
Roman patriotism. Standing up they gave their
orders:</p>

<p>"Strip them, flog them."</p>

<p>The slaves of the pr&aelig;tors seized Paul and Silas and
took their robes from their backs. They were tied by
their hands to the whipping-post. The crowd gathered
round to see the foreigners thrashed.</p>

<p>The lictors&mdash;that is the soldier-servants of the
pr&aelig;tors&mdash;untied their bundles of rods. Then each
lictor brought down his rod with cruel strokes on Paul
and Silas. The rods cut into the flesh and the blood
flowed down.</p>

<p>Then their robes were thrown over their shoulders,
and the two men, with their tortured backs bleeding,
were led into the black darkness of the cell of the city
prison; shackles were snapped on to their arms, and
their feet were clapped into stocks. Their bodies
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>ached; the other prisoners groaned and cursed; the
filthy place stank; sleep was impossible.</p>

<p>But Paul and Silas did not groan. They sang the
songs of their own people, such as the verses that Paul
had learned&mdash;as all Jewish children did&mdash;when he was
a boy at school. For instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">God is our refuge and strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A very present help in trouble.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And though the mountains be moved in the heart of the seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they sang there came a noise as though the mountains
really were shaking. The ground rocked; the
walls shook; the chains were loosened from the stones;
the stocks were wrenched apart; their hands and feet
were free; the heavy doors crashed open. It was an
earthquake.</p>

<p>The jailor leapt to the entrance of the prison. The
moonlight shone on his sword as he was about to kill
himself, thinking his prisoners had escaped.</p>

<p>"Do not harm yourself," shouted Paul. "We are
all here."</p>

<p>"Torches! Torches!" yelled the jailor.</p>

<p>The jailor, like all the people of his land, believed
that earthquakes were sent by God. He thought he
was lost. He turned to Paul and Silas who, he knew,
were teachers about God.</p>

<p>"Sirs," he said, falling in fear on the ground, "what
must I do to be saved?"</p>

<p>"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ," they replied,
"and you and your household will all be saved."</p>

<p>The jailor's wife then brought some oil and water,
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>and the jailor washed the poor wounded backs of Paul
and Silas and rubbed healing oil into them.</p>

<p>The night was now passing and the sun began to
rise. There was a tramp of feet. The lictors who had
thrashed Paul and Silas marched to the door of the
prison with an order to free them. The jailor was delighted.</p>

<p>"The pr&aelig;tors have sent to set you free," he said.
"Come out then and go in peace."</p>

<p>He had the greatest surprise in his life when, instead
of going, Paul turned and said:</p>

<p>"No, indeed! The pr&aelig;tors flogged us in public in
the Forum and without a trial&mdash;flogged Roman citizens!
They threw us publicly into prison, and now
they are going to get rid of us secretly. Let the pr&aelig;tors
come here themselves and take us out!"</p>

<p>Surely it was the boldest message ever sent to the
powerful pr&aelig;tors. But Paul knew what he was doing,
and when the Roman pr&aelig;tors heard the message they
knew that he was right. They would be ruined if it
were reported at Rome that they had publicly flogged
Roman citizens without trial.</p>

<p>Their prisoner, Paul, was now their judge. They
climbed down from their marble seats and walked on
foot to the prison to plead with Paul and Silas to leave
the prison and not to tell against them what had happened.</p>

<p>"Will you go away from the city?" they asked. "We
are afraid of other riots."</p>

<p>So Paul and Silas consented. But they went to the
house where Lydia lived&mdash;the home in which they had
been staying in Philippi.</p>

<p><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>Paul cheered up the other Christian folk&mdash;Lydia and
Luke and Timothy&mdash;and told them how the jailor and
his wife and family had all become Christians.</p>

<p>"Keep the work of spreading the message here in
Philippi going strongly," said Paul to Luke and Timothy.
"Be cheerfully prepared for trouble." And then
he and Silas, instead of going back to their own land,
went out together in the morning light of the early winter
of A.D. 50, away along the Western road over the
hills to face perils in other cities in order to carry the
Good News to the people of the West.</p>


<p><i>The Trail of the Hero-Scout.</i></p>

<p>So Paul the dauntless pioneer set his brave face
westwards, following the long trail across the Roman
Empire&mdash;the hero-scout of Christ. Nothing could stop
him&mdash;not scourgings nor stonings, prison nor robbers,
blizzards nor sand-storms. He went on and on till at
last, as a prisoner in Rome, he laid his head on
the block of the executioner and was slain. These are
the brave words that we hear from him as he came
near to the end:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>I HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT;<br />
I HAVE RUN MY COURSE;<br />
I HAVE KEPT THE FAITH.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Long years afterward, men who were Christians in
Rome carried the story of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ
across Europe to some savages in the North Sea Islands&mdash;called
Britons. Paul handed the torch from the<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>
Near East to the people in Rome. They passed the
torch on to the people of Britain&mdash;and from Britain
many years later men sailed to build up the new great
nation in America. So the torch has run from East to
West, from that day to this, and from those people of
long ago to us. But we owe this most of all to Paul,
the first missionary, who gave his life to bring the
Good News from the lands of Syria and Jud&aelig;a, where
our Lord Jesus Christ lived and died and rose again.</p>

<h4>THE MEN OF THE SHINGLE BEACH</h4>

<h4><i>Wilfrid of Sussex</i></h4>

<p class='center'>(Date, born A.D. 634. Incidents A.D. 666 and 681<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>)</p>


<p>Twelve hundred and fifty years ago a man named
Wilfrid sailed along the south coast of a great island in
the North Seas. With him in the ship were a hundred
and twenty companions.</p>

<p>The voyage had started well, but now the captain
looked anxious as he peered out under his curved hand,
looking first south and then north. There was danger
in both directions.</p>

<p>The breeze from the south stiffened to a gale. The
mast creaked and strained as the gathering storm tore
at the mainsail. The ship reeled and pitched as the
spiteful waves smote her high bow and swept hissing
and gurgling along the deck. She began to jib like a
horse and refused to obey her rudder. Wind and current
were carrying her out of her course.</p>

<p>In spite of all the captain's sea-craft the ship was
being driven nearer to the dreaded, low, shingle beach
of the island that stretched along the northern edge of
the sea. The captain did not fear the coast itself, for
it had no rocks. But the lines deepened on his weather-scarred
face as he saw, gathering on the shelving
beach, the wild, yellow-haired men of the island.</p>

<p><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>The ship was being carried nearer and nearer to the
coast. All on board could now see the Men of the
Shingle Beach waving their spears and axes.</p>

<p>The current and the wind swung the ship still closer
to the shore, and now&mdash;even above the whistle of the
gale in the cordage&mdash;the crew heard the wild whoop of
the wreckers. These men on the beach were the sons of
pirates. But they were now cowards compared with
their fathers. For they no longer lived by the wild
sea-rover's fight that had made their fathers' blood leap
with the joy of the battle. They lived by a crueller
craft. Waiting till some such vessel as this was swept
ashore, they would swoop down on it, harry and slay
the men, carry the women and children off for slaves,
break up the ship and take the wood and stores for fire
and food. They were beach-combers.</p>

<p>An extra swing of the tide, a great wave&mdash;and with a
thud the ship was aground, stuck fast on the yielding
sands. With a wild yell, and with their tawny manes
streaming in the wind, the wreckers rushed down the
beach brandishing their spears.</p>

<p>Wilfrid, striding to the side of the ship, raised his
hand to show that he wished to speak to the chief. But
the island men rushed on like an avalanche and started
to storm the ship. Snatching up arms, poles, rope-ends&mdash;whatever
they could find&mdash;the men on board beat
down upon the heads of the savages as they climbed up
the ship's slippery side. One man after another sank
wounded on the deck. The fight grew more obstinate,
but at last the men of the beach drew back up the sands,
baffled.</p>

<p>The Men of the Shingle Beach might have given up
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>the battle had not a fierce priest of their god of war
leapt on to a mound of sand, and, lifting his naked arms
to the skies, called on the god to destroy the men in the
ship.</p>

<p>The savages were seized with a new frenzy and
swept down the beach again. Wilfrid had gathered
his closest friends round him and was quietly kneeling
on the deck praying to his God for deliverance from the
enemy. The fight became desperate. Again the savages
were driven back up the beach.</p>

<p>Once more they rallied and came swooping down on
the ship. But a pebble from the sling of a man on the
ship struck the savage priest on the forehead; he tottered
and fell on the sand. This infuriated the savages,
yet it took the heart out of these men who had
trusted in their god of war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tide had been creeping up; it swung in
still further and lifted the ship from the sand; the wind
veered, the sails strained. Slowly, but with gathering
speed, the ship stood out to sea followed by howls of
rage from the men on the beach.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some years passed by, yet Wilfrid in all his travels
had never forgotten the Men of the Beach. And,
strangely enough, he wanted to go back to them.</p>

<p>At last the time came when he could do so. This
time he did not visit them by sea. After he had
preached among the people in a distant part of the same
great island, Wilfrid with four faithful companions&mdash;Eappa,
Padda, Burghelm and Oiddi&mdash;walked down to
the south coast of the island.</p>

<p>As he came to the tribe he found many of them
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>gathered on the beach as before. But the fierceness was
gone. They tottered with weakness as they walked.
The very bones seemed ready to come through their
skin. They were starving with hunger and thirst from
a long drought, when no grain or food of any kind
would grow. And now they were gathered on the
shore, and a long row of them linked hand in hand
would rush down the very beach upon which they had
attacked Wilfrid, and would cast themselves into the
sea to get out of the awful agonies of their hunger.</p>

<p>"Are there not fish in the sea for food?" asked
Wilfrid.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we cannot catch them," they answered.</p>

<p>Wilfrid showed the wondering Men of the Shingle
Beach how to make large nets and then launched out
in the little boats that they owned, and let the nets
down. For hour after hour Wilfrid and his companions
fished, while the savages watched them from
the beach with hungry eyes as the silver-shining fish
were drawn gleaming and struggling into the boats.</p>

<p>At last, as evening drew on, the nets were drawn in
for the last time, and Wilfrid came back to the beach
with hundreds of fish in the boats. With eager joy the
Men of the Beach lit fires and cooked the fish. Their
hunger was stayed; the rain for which Wilfrid prayed
came. They were happy once more.</p>

<p>Then Wilfrid gathered them all around him on the
beach and said words like these:</p>

<p>"You men tried to kill me and my friends on this
beach years ago, trusting in your god of war. You
<i>failed</i>. There is no god of war. There is but one God,
a God not of war, but of Love, Who sent His only Son
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>to tell about His love. That Son, Jesus Christ, Who
fed the hungry multitudes by the side of the sea with
fish, sent me to you to show love to you, feeding you
with fish from the sea, and feeding you with His love,
which is the Bread of Life."</p>

<p>The wondering savages, spear in hand, shook their
matted hair and could not take it in at once. Yet they
and their boys and girls had already learned to trust
Wilfrid, and soon began to love the God of Whom he
spoke.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Now, those savages were the great, great, great
grandfathers and mothers of the English-speaking
peoples of the world. The North Sea Island was Britain;
the beach was at Selsey near Chichester on the
South Coast. And the very fact that you and I are
alive to-day, the shelter of our homes, the fact that we
can enjoy the wind on the heath in camp, our books
and sport and school, all these things come to us through
men like Wilfrid and St. Patrick, St. Columba and St.
Ninian, St. Augustine and others who in the days of
long ago came to lift our fathers from the wretched,
quarrelsome life, and from the starving helplessness of
the Men of the Shingle Beach.</p>

<p>The people of the North Sea Islands and of America
and the rest of the Christian world have these good
things in their life because there came to save our forefathers
heroic missionaries like Wilfrid, Columba, and
Augustine. There are to-day men of the South Sea
Islands, who are even more helpless than our Saxon
grandfathers.</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>To get without giving is mean. To take the torch
and not to pass it on is to fail to play the game. We
must hand on to the others the light that has come
to us.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>THE KNIGHT OF A NEW CRUSADE</h4>

<h4><i>Raymund Lull</i></h4>

<p class='center'>(Dates, b. 1234, d. 1315)</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>A little old man, barefooted and bareheaded, and
riding upon an ass, went through the cities and towns
and villages of Europe, in the eleventh century, carrying&mdash;not
a lance, but a crucifix. When he came near
a town the word ran like a forest fire, "It is Peter the
Hermit."</p>

<p>All the people rushed out. Their hearts burned as
they heard him tell how the tomb of Jesus Christ was
in the hand of the Moslem Turk, of how Christians
going to worship at His Tomb in Jerusalem were
thrown into prison and scourged and slain. Knights
sold lands and houses to buy horses and lances. Peasants
threw down the axe and the spade for the pike and
bow and arrows. Led by knights, on whose armour
a red Cross was emblazoned, the people poured out in
their millions for the first Crusade. It is said that in
the spring of 1096 an "expeditionary force" of six
million people was heading toward Palestine.</p>

<p>The Crusades were caused partly by the cruelty of
the followers of Mohammed, the Moslem Turks, who
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>believed that they could earn entrance into Paradise by
slaying infidel Christians. The Moslems every day and
five times a day turn their faces to Mecca in Arabia,
saying "There is no God but God; Mohammed is the
Prophet of God." Allah (they believe) is wise and
merciful to His own, but not holy, nor our Father, nor
loving and forgiving, nor desiring pure lives. On earth
and in Paradise women have no place save to serve men.</p>

<p>The first Crusade ended in the capture of Jerusalem
(July 15, 1099), and Godfrey de Bouillon became King
of Jerusalem. But Godfrey refused to put a crown
upon his head. For, he said, "I will not wear a crown
of gold in the city where Our Lord Jesus Christ wore a
crown of thorns."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The fortunes of Christian and Moslem ebbed and flowed
for nearly two hundred years, during which time there were
seven Crusades ending at the fall of Acre into the hands
of the Turks in 1291.</p>

<p>The way of the sword had failed, though indeed the Crusades
had probably been the means of preventing all Europe
from being overrun by the Moslems. At the time when the
last Crusade had begun a man was planning a new kind of
Crusade, different in method but calling for just as much
bravery as the old kind. We are going to hear his story now.</p></div>


<h4>II</h4>

<p><i>The Young Knight's Vision</i></p>

<p>In the far-off days of the last of the Crusades, a
knight of Majorca, in the Mediterranean Sea, stood
on the shore of his island home gazing over the water.
Raymund Lull from the beach of Palma Bay, where
he had played as a boy, now looked out southward,
where boats with their tall, rakish, brown sails ran in
from the Great Sea.</p>

<p><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>The knight was dreaming of Africa which lay away
to the south of his island. He had heard many strange
stories from the sailors about the life in the harbours
of that mysterious African seaboard; but he had never
once in his thirty-six years set eyes upon one of its
ports.</p>

<p>It was the year when Prince Edward of England,
out on the mad, futile adventure of the last Crusade,
was felled by the poisoned dagger of an assassin in
Nazareth, and when Eleanor (we are told) drew the
poison from the wound with her own lips. Yet Raymund
Lull, who was a knight so skilled that he could
flash his sword and set his lance in rest with any of his
peers, had not joined that Crusade. His brave father
carried the scars of a dozen battles against the Moors.
Yet, when the last Crusade swept down the Mediterranean,
Lull stood aside; for he was himself planning
a new Crusade of a kind unlike any that had gone
before.</p>

<p>He dreamed of a Crusade not to the Holy Land but
to Africa, where the Crescent of Mohammed ruled and
where the Cross of Christ was never seen save when
an arrogant Moslem drew a cross in the sand of the
desert to spit upon it. It was the desire of Raymund
Lull's life to sail out into those perilous ports and to
face the fierce Saracens who thronged the cities. He
longed for this as other knights panted to go out to the
Holy Land as Crusaders. He was rich enough to sail
at any time, for he was his own master. Why, then,
did he not take one of the swift craft that rocked in
the bay, and sail?</p>

<p>It was because he had not yet forged a sharp enough
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>weapon for his new Crusade. His deep resolve was
that at all costs he would "Be Prepared" for every
counter-stroke of the Saracen whose tongue was as
swift and sharp as his scimitar.</p>

<p>What powers do we think a man should have in
order to convince fanatical Moslems, who knew their
own sacred book&mdash;the Koran&mdash;of the truth of Christianity?
Control of his own temper, courage, patience,
knowledge of the Moslem religion and of the Bible,
suggest themselves.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p><i>The Preparation of Temper</i></p>

<p>So Lull turned his back on the beach and on Africa,
and plunged under the heavy shadows of the arched
gateway through the city wall up the narrow streets of
Palma. A servant opened the heavy, studded door of
his father's mansion&mdash;the house where Lull himself
was born.</p>

<p>He hastened in and, calling to his Saracen slave,
strode to his own room. The dark-faced Moor obediently
came, bowed before his young master, and laid
out on the table manuscripts that were covered with
mysterious writing such as few people in Europe could
read.</p>

<p>Lull was learning Arabic from this sullen Saracen
slave. He was studying the Koran&mdash;the Bible of the
Mohammedans&mdash;so that he might be able to strive with
the Saracens on their own ground. For Lull knew that
he must be master of all the knowledge of the Moslem if
he was to win his battles; just as a knight in the fighting
Crusades must be swift and sure with his sword.<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>
And this is how Lull spoke of the Crusade on which he
was to set out.</p>

<p>"I see many knights," he said, "going to the Holy
Land beyond the seas and thinking that they can acquire
it by force of arms; but in the end all are destroyed
before they attain that which they think to
have. Whence it seems to me that the conquest of the
Holy Land ought not to be attempted except in the way
in which Christ and His Apostles achieved it, namely,
by love and prayers, and the pouring out of tears and
blood."</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he and the Saracen slave argued together,
the Moor blurted out passionately a horrible
blasphemy against the name of Jesus. Lull's blood
was up. He leapt to his feet, leaned forward, and
caught the Moor a swinging blow on the face with his
hand. In a fury the Saracen snatched a dagger from
the folds of his robe and, leaping at Lull, drove it into
his side. Raymund fell with a cry. Friends rushed in.
The Saracen was seized and hurried away to a prison-cell,
where he slew himself.</p>

<p>Lull, as he lay day after day waiting for his wound
to heal and remembering his wild blow at the Saracen,
realised that, although he had learned Arabic, he had
not yet learned the first lesson of his own new way of
Crusading&mdash;to be master of himself.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p><i>The Preparation of Courage</i></p>

<p>So Raymund Lull (at home and in Rome and Paris)
set himself afresh to his task of preparing. At last
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>he felt that he was ready. From Paris he rode south-east
through forest and across plain, over mountain and
pass, till the gorgeous palaces and the thousand masts
of Genoa came in sight.</p>

<p>He went down to the harbour and found a ship that
was sailing across the Mediterranean to Africa. He
booked his passage and sent his goods with all his
precious manuscripts aboard. The day for sailing
came. His friends came to cheer him. But Lull sat
in his room trembling.</p>

<p>As he covered his eyes with his hands in shame, he
saw the fiery, persecuting Saracens of Tunis, whom he
was sailing to meet. He knew they were glowing with
pride because of their triumphs over the Crusaders in
Palestine. He knew they were blazing with anger because
their brother Moors had been slaughtered and
tortured in Spain. He saw ahead of him the rack, the
thumb-screw, and the boot; the long years in a slimy
dungeon&mdash;at the best the executioner's scimitar. He
simply dared not go.</p>

<p>The books were brought ashore again. The ship
sailed without Lull.</p>

<p>"The ship has gone," said a friend to Lull. He
quivered under a torture of shame greater than the
agony of the rack. He was wrung with bitter shame
that he who had for all these years prepared for this
Crusade should now have shown the white feather.
He was, indeed, a craven knight of Christ.</p>

<p>His agony of spirit threw him into a high fever that
kept him in his bed.</p>

<p>Soon after he heard that another ship was sailing
for Africa.</p>

<p><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>In spite of the protestations of his friends Lull insisted
that they should carry him to the ship. They
did so; but as the hour of sailing drew on his friends
were sure that he was so weak that he would die on the
sea before he could reach Africa. So&mdash;this time in
spite of all his pleading&mdash;they carried him ashore
again. But he could not rest and his agony of mind
made his fever worse.</p>

<p>Soon, however, a third ship was making ready to
sail. This time Lull was carried on board and refused
to return.</p>

<p>The ship cast off and threaded its way through the
shipping of the harbour out into the open sea.</p>

<p>"From this moment," said Lull, "I was a new man.
All fever left me almost before we were out of sight
of land."</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p><i>The First Battle</i></p>

<p>Passing Corsica and Sardinia, the ship slipped southward
till at last she made the yellow coast of Africa,
broken by the glorious Gulf of Tunis. She dropped
sail as she ran alongside the busy wharves of Goletta.
Lull was soon gliding in a boat through the short
ancient canal to Tunis, the mighty city which was head
of all the Western Mohammedan world.</p>

<p>He landed and found the place beside the great
mosque where the grey-bearded scholars bowed over
their Korans and spoke to one another about the law
of Mohammed.</p>

<p>They looked at him with amazement as he boldly
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>came up to them and said, "I have come to talk with you
about Christ and His Way of Life, and Mohammed
and his teaching. If you can prove to me that Mohammed
is indeed <i>the</i> Prophet, I will myself become a
follower of him."</p>

<p>The Moslems, sure of their case, called together
their wisest men and together they declaimed to Lull
what he already knew very well&mdash;the watchword that
rang out from minaret to minaret across the roofs of
the vast city as the first flush of dawn came up from the
East across the Gulf. "There is no God but God; Mohammed
is the Prophet of God."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "the Allah of Mohammed is one
and is great, but He does not love as does the Father
of Jesus Christ. He is wise, but He does not do good
to men like our God who so loved the world that He
gave His Son Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>To and fro the argument swung till, after many
days, to their dismay and amazement the Moslems saw
some of their number waver and at last actually beginning
to go over to the side of Lull. To forsake the
Faith of Mohammed is&mdash;by their own law&mdash;to be
worthy of death. A Moslem leader hurried to the
Sultan of Tunis.</p>

<p>"See," he said, "this learned teacher, Lull, is declaring
the errors of the Faith. He is dangerous. Let
us take him and put him to death."</p>

<p>The Sultan gave the word of command. A body of
soldiers went out, seized Lull, dragged him through the
streets, and threw him into a dark dungeon to wait
the death sentence.</p>

<p><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>But another Moslem who had been deeply touched
by Lull's teaching craved audience with the Sultan.</p>

<p>"See," he said, "this learned man Lull&mdash;if he were
a Moslem&mdash;would be held in high honour, being so
brave and fearless in defence of his Faith. Do not
slay him. Banish him from Tunis."</p>

<p>So when Lull in his dungeon saw the door flung
open and waited to be taken to his death he found to
his surprise that he was led from the dungeon through
the streets of Tunis, taken along the canal, thrust into
the hold of a ship, and told that he must go in that ship
to Genoa and never return. But the man who had
before been afraid to sail from Genoa to Tunis, now
escaped unseen from the ship that would have taken
him back to safety in order to risk his life once more.
He said to himself the motto he had written:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='center'>"HE WHO LOVES NOT, LIVES NOT! HE WHO<br />
LIVES BY THE LIFE CANNOT DIE."</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>He was not afraid now even of martyrdom. He hid
among the wharves and gathered his converts about
him to teach them more and more about Christ.</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p><i>The Last Fight</i></p>

<p>At last, however, seeing that he could do little in
hiding, Lull took ship to Naples. After many adventures
during a number of years, in a score of cities
and on the seas, the now white-haired Lull sailed into
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>the curved bay of Bugia farther westward along the
African coast. In the bay behind the frowning walls
the city with its glittering mosques climbed the hill.
Behind rose two glorious mountains crowned with the
dark green of the cedar. And, far off, like giant Moors
wearing white turbans, rose the distant mountain peaks
crowned with snow.</p>

<p>Lull passed quietly through the arch of the city gateway
which he knew so well, for among other adventures
he had once been imprisoned in this very city. He
climbed the steep street and found a friend who hid
him away. There for a year Lull taught in secret till he
felt that the time had come for him to go out boldly
and dare death itself.</p>

<p>One day the people in the market-place of Bugia
heard a voice ring out that seemed to some of them
strangely familiar. They hurried toward the sound.
There stood the old hero with arm uplifted declaring, in
the full blaze of the North African day, the Love of
God shown in Jesus Christ His Son.</p>

<p>The Saracens murmured. They could not answer
his arguments. They cried to him to stop, but his
voice rose ever fuller and bolder. They rushed on
him, dragged him by the cloak out of the market-place,
down the streets, under the archway to a place beyond
the city walls. There they threw back their sleeves,
took up great jagged stones and hurled these grim messengers
of hate at the Apostle of Love, till he sank
senseless to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It was word for word over again the story of
Stephen; the speech, the wild cries of the mob, the
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>rush to the place beyond the city wall, the stoning.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Did Lull accomplish anything? He was dead; but
he had conquered. He had conquered his old self.
For the Lull who had, in a fit of temper, smitten his
Saracen slave now smiled on the men who stoned him;
and the Lull who had showed the white feather of fear
at Genoa, now defied death in the market-place of
Bugia. And in that love and heroism, in face of hate
and death, he had shown men the only way to conquer
the scimitar of Mohammed, "the way in which Christ
and His Apostles achieved it, namely, by love and prayers,
and the pouring out of tears and blood."</p>

<h4>FRANCIS C&OElig;UR-DE-LION</h4>

<h4>
(<i>St. Francis of Assisi</i>)<br /></h4>

<p class='center'>A.D. 1181-1226<br />
(Date of Incident, 1219)<br />
</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The dark blue sky of an Italian night was studded
with sparkling stars that seemed to be twinkling with
laughter at the pranks of a lively group of gay young
fellows as they came out from a house half-way up the
steep street of the little city of Assisi.</p>

<p>As they strayed together down the street they sang
the love-songs of their country and then a rich, strong
voice rang out singing a song in French.</p>

<p>"That is Francis Bernardone," one neighbour would
say to another, nodding his head, for Francis could
sing, not only in his native Italian, but also in French.</p>

<p>"He lives like a prince; yet he is but the son of a
cloth merchant,&mdash;rich though the merchant be."</p>

<p>So the neighbours, we are told, were always grumbling
about Francis, the wild spendthrift. For young
Francis dressed in silk and always in the latest fashion;
he threw his pocket-money about with a free hand.
He loved beautiful things. He was very sensitive. He
would ride a long way round to avoid seeing the dread<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>ful
face of a poor leper, and would hold his nose in his
cloak as he passed the place where the lepers lived.</p>

<p>He was handsome in face, gallant in bearing, idle
and careless; a jolly companion, with beautiful courtly
manners. His dark chestnut hair curled over his
smooth, rather small forehead. His black twinkling
eyes looked out under level brows; his nose was straight
and finely shaped.</p>

<p>When he laughed he showed even, white, closely set
teeth between thin and sensitive lips. He wore a short,
black beard. His arms were shortish; his fingers long
and sensitive. He was lightly built; his skin was delicate.</p>

<p>He was witty, and his voice when he spoke was powerful
and sonorous, yet sweet-toned and very clear.</p>

<p>For him to be the son of a merchant seemed to the
gossips of Assisi all wrong&mdash;as though a grey goose
had hatched out a gorgeous peacock.</p>

<p>The song of the revellers passed down the street and
died away. The little city of Assisi slept in quietness
on the slopes of the Apennine Mountains under the
dark clear sky.</p>

<p>A few nights later, however, no song of any revellers
was heard. Francis Bernardone was very ill with a
fever. For week after week his mother nursed him;
and each night hardly believed that her son would live
to see the light of the next morning. When at last the
fever left him, he was so feeble that for weeks he could
not rise from his bed. Gradually, however, he got better:
as he did so the thing that he desired most of all
in the world was to see the lovely country around<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
Assisi;&mdash;the mountains, the Umbrian Plain beneath,
the blue skies, the dainty flowers.</p>

<p>At last one day, with aching limbs and in great
feebleness, he crept out of doors. There were the great
Apennine Mountains on the side of which his city of
Assisi was built. There were the grand rocky peaks
pointing to the intense blue sky. There was the steep
street with the houses built of stone of a strange, delicate
pink colour, as though the light of dawn were always
on them. There were the dark green olive trees,
and the lovely tendrils of the vines. The gay Italian
flowers were blooming.</p>

<p>Stretching away in the distance was one of the most
beautiful landscapes of the world; the broad Umbrian
Plain with its browns and greens melting in the distance
into a bluish haze that softened the lines of the
distant hills.</p>

<p>How he had looked forward to seeing it all, to being
in the sunshine, to feeling the breeze on his hot brow!
But what&mdash;he wondered&mdash;had happened to him? He
looked at it all, but he felt no joy. It all seemed dead
and empty. He turned his back on it and crawled indoors
again, sad and sick at heart. He was sure that
he would never feel again "the wild joys of living."</p>

<p>As Francis went back to his bed he began to think
what he should do with the rest of his life. He made
up his mind not to waste it any longer: but he did not
see clearly what he should do with it.</p>

<p>A short time after Francis begged a young nobleman
of Assisi, who was just starting to fight in a war, if he
might go with him. The nobleman&mdash;Walter of
Brienne, agreed: so Francis bought splendid trappings
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>for his horse, and a shield, sword and spear. His
armour and his horse's harness were more splendid
than even those of Walter. So they went clattering together
out of Assisi.</p>

<p>But he had not gone thirty miles before he was smitten
again by fever. After sunset one evening he lay
dreamily on his bed when he seemed to hear a voice.</p>

<p>"Francis," it asked, "what could benefit thee most,
the master or the servant, the rich man or the poor?"</p>

<p>"The master and the rich man," answered Francis in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Why then," went on the voice, "dost thou leave God,
Who is the Master and rich, for man, who is the servant
and poor?"</p>

<p>"Then, Lord, what will Thou that I do?" asked
Francis.</p>

<p>"Return to thy native town, and it shall be shown
thee there what thou shall do," said the voice.</p>

<p>He obediently rose and went back to Assisi. He
tried to join again in the old revels, but the joy was
gone. He went quietly away to a cave on the mountain
side and there he lay&mdash;as young Mahomet had done,
you remember, five centuries before, to wonder what
he was to do.</p>

<p>Then a vision came to him. All at once like a flash
his mind was clear, and his soul was full of joy. He
saw the love of Jesus Christ&mdash;Who had lived and suffered
and died for love of him and of all men;&mdash;that
love was to rule his own life! He had found his Captain&mdash;the
Master of his life, the Lord of his service,&mdash;Christ.</p>

<p>Yet even now he hardly knew what to do. He went
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>home and told his friends as well as he could of the
change in his heart.</p>

<p>Some smiled rather pityingly and went away saying
to one another: "Poor fellow; a little mad, you can
see; very sad for his parents!"</p>

<p>Others simply laughed and mocked.</p>

<p>One day, very lonely and sad at heart, he clambered
up the mountain side to an old church just falling into
ruin near which, in a cavern, lived a priest. He went
into the ruin and fell on his knees.</p>

<p>"Francis," a voice in his soul seemed to say, "dost
thou see my house going to ruin. Buckle to and repair
it."</p>

<p>He dashed home, saddled his horse, loaded it with
rich garments and rode off to another town to sell the
goods. He sold the horse too; trudged back up the
hill and gave the fat purse to the priest.</p>

<p>"No," said the priest, "I dare not take it unless your
father says I may."</p>

<p>But his father, who had got rumour of what was
going on, came with a band of friends to drag Francis
home. Francis fled through the woods to a secret cave,
where he lay hidden till at last he made up his mind
to face all. He came out and walked straight towards
home. Soon the townsmen of Assisi caught sight of
him.</p>

<p>"A madman," they yelled, throwing stones and sticks
at him. All the boys of Assisi came out and hooted
and threw pebbles.</p>

<p>His father heard the riot and rushed out to join in
the fun. Imagine his horror when he found that it was
his own son. He yelled with rage, dashed at him and,
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>clutching him by the robe, dragged him along, beating
and cursing him. When he got him home he locked
him up. But some days later Francis' mother let him
out, when his father was absent; and Francis climbed
the hill to the Church.</p>

<p>The bishop called in Francis and his father to his
court to settle the quarrel.</p>

<p>"You must give back to your father all that you
have," said he.</p>

<p>"I will," replied Francis.</p>

<p>He took off all his rich garments; and, clad only in a
hair-vest, he put the clothes and the purse of money at
his father's feet.</p>

<p>"Now," he cried, "I have but one father. Henceforth
I can say in all truth 'Our Father Who art in
heaven.'"</p>

<p>A peasant's cloak was given to Francis. He went
thus, without home or any money, a wanderer. He
went to a monastery and slaved in the kitchen. A
friend gave him a tunic, some shoes, and a stick. He
went out wandering in Italy again. He loved everybody;
he owned nothing; he wanted everyone to know
the love of Jesus as he knew and enjoyed that love.</p>

<p>There came to Francis many adventures. He was
full of joy; he sang even to the birds in the woods.
Many men joined him as his disciples in the way of
obedience, of poverty, and of love. Men in Italy, in
Spain, in Germany and in Britain caught fire from the
flame of his simple love and careless courage. Never
had Europe seen so clear a vision of the love of Jesus.
His followers were called the Lesser Brothers (Friars
Minor).</p>

<p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>All who can should read the story of Francis' life:
as for us we are here going simply to listen to what
happened to him on a strange and perilous adventure.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>About this time people all over Europe were agog
with excitement about the Crusades. Four Crusades
had come and gone. Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion was dead.
But the passion for fighting against the Saracen was
still in the hearts of men.</p>

<p>"The tomb of our Lord in Jerusalem is in the hands
of the Saracen," the cry went up over all Europe.
"Followers of Jesus Christ are slain by the scimitars
of Islam. Let us go and wrest the Holy City from the
hands of the Saracen."</p>

<p>There was also the danger to Europe itself. The
Mohammedans ruled in Spain as well as in North
Africa, in Egypt and in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>So rich men sold their lands to buy horses and armour
and to fit themselves and their foot soldiers for
the fray. Poor men came armed with pike and helmet
and leather jerkin. The knights wore a blood-red
cross on their white tunics. In thousands upon thousands,
with John of Brienne as their Commander-in-Chief
(the brother of that Walter of Brienne with
whom, you remember, Francis had started for the wars
as a knight), they sailed the Mediterranean to fight
for the Cross in Egypt.</p>

<p>They attacked Egypt because the Sultan there ruled
over Jerusalem and they hoped by defeating him to
free Jerusalem at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>As Francis saw the knights going off to the Crusades
in shining armour with the trappings of their horses
all a-glitter and a-jingle, and as he thought of the lands
where the people worshipped&mdash;not the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;but the "Sultan in the
Sky," the Allah of Mahomet, his spirit caught fire
within him.</p>

<p>Francis had been a soldier and a knight only a few
years before. He could not but feel the stir of the
Holy War in his veins,&mdash;the tingle of the desire to be
in it. He heard the stories of the daring of the Crusaders;
he heard of a great victory over the Saracens.</p>

<p>Francis, indeed, wanted Jesus Christ to conquer men
more than he wanted anything on earth; but he knew
that men are only conquered by Jesus Christ if their
hearts are changed by Him.</p>

<p>"Even if the Saracens are put to the sword and overwhelmed,
still they are not saved," he said to himself.</p>

<p>As he thought these things he felt sure that he heard
them calling to him (as the Man from Macedonia had
called to St. Paul)&mdash;"Come over and help us." St.
Paul had brought the story of Jesus Christ to Europe;
and had suffered prison and scourging and at last death
by the executioner's sword in doing it; must not Francis
be ready to take the same message back again from
Europe to the Near East and to suffer for it?</p>

<p>"I will go," he said, "but to save the Saracens, not
to slay them."</p>

<p>He was not going out to fight, yet he had in his heart
a plan that needed him to be braver and more full of
resource than any warrior in the armies of the Crusades.
He was as much a Lion-hearted hero as Richard<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
C&oelig;ur-de-Lion himself, and was far wiser and indeed
more powerful.</p>

<p>So he took a close friend, Brother Illuminato, with
him and they sailed away together over the seas. They
sailed from Italy with Walter of Brienne, with one of
the Crusading contingents in many ships. Southeast
they voyaged over the blue waters of the Mediterranean
Sea.</p>

<p>Francis talked with the Crusaders on board; and
much that they said and did made him very sad. They
squabbled with one another. The knights were arrogant
and sneered at the foot soldiers; the men-at-arms
did not trust the knights. They had the Cross
on their armour; but few of them had in their hearts
the spirit of Jesus who was nailed to the Cross.</p>

<p>At last the long, yellow coast-line of Egypt was
sighted. Behind it lay the minarets and white roofs
of a city. They were come to the eastern mouth of the
Nile, on which stood the proud city of Damietta. The
hot rays of the sun smote down upon the army of the
Crusaders as they landed. The sky and the sea were
of an intense blue; the sand and the sun glared at one
another.</p>

<p>Francis would just be able to hear at dawn the cry
of the muezzin from the minarets of Damietta, "Come
to prayer: there is no God but Allah and Mahomet
is his prophet. Come to prayer. Prayer is better than
sleep."</p>

<p>John of Brienne began to muster his men in battle
array to attack the Sultan of Egypt, Malek-Kamel, a
name which means "the Perfect Prince."</p>

<p>Francis, however, was quite certain that the attempt
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>would be a ghastly failure. He hardly knew what to
do. So he talked it over with his friend, Brother Illuminato.</p>

<p>"I know they will be defeated in this attempt," he
said. "But if I tell them so they will treat me as a
madman. On the other hand, if I do not tell them,
then my conscience will condemn me. What do you
think I ought to do?"</p>

<p>"My brother," said Illuminate, "what does the judgment
of the world matter to you? If they say you are
mad it will not be the first time!"</p>

<p>Francis, therefore, went to the Crusaders and warned
them. They laughed scornfully. The order for advance
was given. The Crusaders charged into battle.
Francis was in anguish&mdash;tears filled his eyes. The
Saracens came out and fell upon the Christian soldiers
and slaughtered them. Over 6000 of them either fell
under the scimitar or were taken prisoner. The Crusaders
were defeated.</p>

<p>Francis' mind was now fully made up. He went to
a Cardinal, who represented the Pope, with the Crusading
Army to ask his leave to go and preach to the
Sultan of Egypt.</p>

<p>"No," said the Cardinal, "I cannot give you leave
to go. I know full well that you would never escape
to come back alive. The Sultan of Egypt has offered a
reward of gold to any man who will bring to him the
head of a Christian. That will be your fate."</p>

<p>"Do suffer us to go, we do not fear death," pleaded
Francis and Illuminato, again and again.</p>

<p>"I do not know what is in your minds in this," said
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>the Cardinal, "but beware&mdash;if you go&mdash;that your
thoughts are always to God."</p>

<p>"We only wish to go for great good, if we can work
it," replied Francis.</p>

<p>"Then if you wish it so much," the Cardinal at last
agreed, "you may go."</p>

<p>So Francis and Illuminato girded their loins and
tightened their sandals and set away from the Crusading
Army towards the very camp of the enemy.</p>

<p>As he walked Francis sang with his full, loud, clear
voice. These were the words that he sang:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will fear no evil; for thou art with me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>As they walked along over the sandy waste they saw
two small sheep nibbling the sparse grass growing near
the Nile.</p>

<p>"Be of good cheer," said Francis to Illuminato,
smiling, "it is the fulfilling of the Gospel words 'Behold
I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves.'"</p>

<p>Then there appeared some Saracen soldiers. They
were, at first, for letting the two unarmed men go by;
but, on questioning Francis, they grew angrier and
angrier.</p>

<p>"Are you deserters from the Christian camp?" they
asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Francis.</p>

<p>"Are you envoys from the commander come to plead
for peace?"</p>

<p>"No," was the answer again.</p>

<p>"Will you give up the infidel religion and become a
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>true believer and say 'There is no God but Allah, and
Mahomet is his prophet?'"</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Francis, "we are come to preach the
Good News of Jesus Christ to the Sultan of Egypt."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Saracen soldiers opened with amazement:
they could hardly believe their ears. Their faces
flushed under their dark skins with anger.</p>

<p>"Chain them," they cried to one another. "Beat
them&mdash;the infidels."</p>

<p>Chains were brought and snapped upon the wrists
and ankles of Francis and Illuminato. Then they took
rods and began to beat the two men&mdash;just as Paul and
Silas had been beaten eleven centuries earlier.</p>

<p>As the rods whistled through the air and came slashing
upon their wounded backs Francis kept crying out
one word&mdash;"Soldan&mdash;Soldan." That is "Sultan&mdash;Sultan."</p>

<p>He thus made them understand that he wished to be
taken to their Commander-in-Chief. So they decided
to take these strange beings to Malek-Kamel.</p>

<p>As the Sultan sat in his pavilion Francis and Illuminato
were led in. They bowed and saluted him courteously
and Malek-Kamel returned the salute.</p>

<p>"Have you come with a message from your Commander?"
said the Sultan.</p>

<p>"No," replied Francis.</p>

<p>"You wish then to become Saracens&mdash;worshippers
of Allah in the name of Mahomet?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," answered Francis, "Saracens we will
never be. We have come with a message from God;
it is a message that will save your life. If you die
under the law of Mahomet you are lost. We have
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>come to tell you so: if you listen to us we will show
all this to you."</p>

<p>The Sultan seems to have been amused and interested
rather than angry.</p>

<p>"I have bishops and archbishops of my own," he
said, "they can tell me all that I wish to know."</p>

<p>"Of this we are glad," replied Francis, "send and
fetch them, if you will."</p>

<p>The Sultan agreed; he sent for eight of his Moslem
great men. When they came in he said to them: "See
these men, they have come to teach us a new faith.
Shall we listen to them?"</p>

<p>"Sire," they answered him at once, "thou knowest
the law: thou art bound to uphold it and carry it out.
By Mahomet who gave us the law to slay infidels, we
command thee that their heads be cut off. We will not
listen to a word that they say. Off with their heads!"</p>

<p>The great men, having given their judgment, solemnly
left the presence of the Sultan. The Sultan
turned to Francis and Illuminato.</p>

<p>"Masters," he said to them, "they have commanded
me by Mahomet to have your heads cut off. But I will
go against the law, for you have risked your lives to
save my immortal soul. Now leave me for the time."</p>

<p>The two Christian missionaries were led away; but
in a day or two Malek-Kamel called them to his presence
again.</p>

<p>"If you will stay in my dominions," he said, "I will
give you land and other possessions."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Francis, "I will stay&mdash;on one condition&mdash;that
you and your people turn to the worship of the
true God. See," he went on, "let us put it to the test.<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
Your priests here," and he pointed to some who were
standing about, "they will not let me talk with them;
will they do something. Have a great fire lighted. I
will walk into the fire with them: the result will shew
you whose faith is the true one."</p>

<p>As Francis suggested this idea the faces of the Moslem
leaders were transfigured with horror. They
turned and quietly walked away.</p>

<p>"I do not think," said the Sultan with a sarcastic
smile at their retreating backs, "that any of my priests
are ready to face the flames to defend their faith."</p>

<p>"Well, I will go <i>alone</i> into the fire," said Francis.
"If I am burned&mdash;it is because of my sins&mdash;if I am
protected by God then you will own Him as your God."</p>

<p>"No," replied the Sultan, "I will not listen to the idea
of such a trial of your life for my soul." But he was
astonished beyond measure at the amazing faith of
Francis. So Francis withdrew from the presence of
the Sultan, who at once sent after him rich and costly
presents.</p>

<p>"You must take them back," said Francis to the messengers;
"I will not take them."</p>

<p>"Take them to build your churches and support your
priests," said the Sultan through his messengers.</p>

<p>But Francis would not take any gift from the Sultan.
He left him and went back with Illuminato from the
Saracen host to the camp of the Crusaders. As he was
leaving the Sultan secretly spoke with Francis and said:
"Will you pray for me that I may be guided by an inspiration
from above that I may join myself to the religion
that is most approved by God?"</p>

<p>The Sultan told off a band of his soldiers to go with
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>the two men and to protect them from any molesting
till they reached the Crusaders' Camp. There is a
legend&mdash;though no one now can tell whether it is true
or not&mdash;that when the Sultan of Egypt lay dying he
sent for a disciple of Francis to be with him and pray
for him. Whether this was so or not, it is quite clear
that Francis had left in the memory of the Sultan such
a vision of dauntless faith as he had never seen before
or was ever to see again.</p>

<p>The Crusaders failed to win Egypt or the Holy
Land; but to-day men are going from America and
Britain in the footsteps of Francis of Assisi the Christian
missionary, to carry to the people in Egypt, in the
Holy Land and in all the Near East, the message that
Francis took of the love of Jesus Christ. The stories
of some of the deeds they have done and are to-day
doing, we shall read in later chapters in this book.<br /><br /></p>

<h4>THE ADVENTUROUS SHIP</h4>

<h4><i>The Duff</i></h4>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident, 1796)</p>


<p>A ship crept quietly down the River Thames on an
ebb-tide. She was slipping out from the river into the
estuary when suddenly a challenge rang out across the
grey water.</p>

<p>"What ship is that?"</p>

<p>"<i>The Duff</i>," was the answer that came back from the
little ship whose captain had passed through a hundred
hairsbreadth escapes in his life but was now starting on
the strangest adventure of them all.</p>

<p>"Whither bound?" came the challenge again from
the man-o'-war that had hailed them.</p>

<p>"Otaheite," came the answer, which would startle
the Government officer. For Tahiti<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (as we now call
it) was many thousands of miles away in the heart of
the South Pacific Ocean. Indeed it had only been discovered
by Captain Cook twenty-eight years earlier in
1768. <i>The Duff</i> was a small sailing-ship such as one
of our American ocean liners of to-day could put into
her dining saloon.</p>

<p>"What cargo?" The question came again from the
officer on the man-o'-war.</p>

<p><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>"Missionaries and provisions," was Captain Wilson's
answer.</p>

<p>The man-o'-war's captain was puzzled. He did not
know what strange beings might be meant by missionaries.
He was suspicious. Were they pirates, perhaps,
in disguise!</p>

<p>We can understand how curious it would sound to
him when we remember that (although Wilfrid and
Augustine and Columba had gone to Britain as missionaries
over a thousand years before <i>The Duff</i> started
down the Thames) no cargo of missionaries had ever
before sailed from those North Sea Islands of Britain
to the savages of other lands like the South Sea Islands.</p>

<p>There was a hurried order and a scurry on board the
Government ship. A boat was let down into the
Thames, and half a dozen sailors tumbled into her and
rowed to <i>The Duff.</i> What did the officer find?</p>

<p>He was met at the rail by a man who had been
through scores of adventures, Captain Wilson. The
son of the captain of a Newcastle collier, Wilson had
grown up a dare-devil sailor boy. He enlisted as a
soldier in the American war, became captain of a vessel
trading with India, and was then captured and imprisoned
by the French in India. He escaped from prison
by climbing a great wall, and dropping down forty feet
on the other side. He plunged into a river full of alligators,
and swam across, escaping the jaws of alligators
only to be captured on the other bank by Indians,
chained and made to march barefoot for 500 miles.
Then he was thrust into Hyder Ali's loathsome prison,
starved and loaded with irons, and at last at the end of
two years was set free.</p>

<p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>This was the daring hero who had now undertaken
to captain the little <i>Duff</i> across the oceans of the world
to the South Seas. With Captain Wilson, the man-o'-war
officer found also six carpenters, two shoemakers,
two bricklayers, two sailors, two smiths, two weavers, a
surgeon, a hatter, a shopkeeper, a cotton factor, a cabinet-maker,
a draper, a harness maker, a tin worker, a
butcher and four ministers. But they were all of them
missionaries. With them were six children.</p>

<p>All up and down the English Channel French
frigates sailed like hawks waiting to pounce upon their
prey; for England was at war with France in those
days. So for five weary weeks <i>The Duff</i> anchored in
the roadstead of Spithead till, as one of a fleet of fifty-seven
vessels, she could sail down the channel and
across the Bay of Biscay protected by British men-o'-war.
Safely clear of the French cruisers, <i>The Duff</i>
held on alone till the cloud-capped mountain-heights of
Madeira hove in sight.</p>

<p>Across the Atlantic she stood, for the intention was
to sail round South America into the Pacific. But on
trying to round the Cape Horn <i>The Duff</i> met such
violent gales that Captain Wilson turned her in her
tracks and headed back across the Atlantic for the
Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>Week after week for thousands and thousands of
miles she sailed. She had travelled from Rio de Janiero
over 10,000 miles and had only sighted a single
sail&mdash;a longer journey than any ship had ever sailed
without seeing land.</p>

<p>"Shall we see the island to-day?" the boys on board
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>would ask Captain Wilson. Day after day he shook
his head. But one night he said:</p>

<p>"If the wind holds good to-night we shall see an
island in the morning, but not the island where we shall
stop."</p>

<p>"Land ho!" shouted a sailor from the masthead in
the morning, and, sure enough, they saw away on the
horizon, like a cloud on the edge of the sea, the island
of Toobonai.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>As they passed Toobonai the wind rose and howled
through the rigging. It tore at the sail of <i>The Duff,</i>
and the great Pacific waves rolled swiftly by, rushing
and hissing along the sides of the little ship and tossing
her on their foaming crests. But she weathered the
storm, and, as the wind dropped, and they looked
ahead, they saw, cutting into the sky-line, the mountain
tops of Tahiti.</p>

<p>It was Saturday night when the island came in sight.
Early on the Sunday morning by seven o'clock <i>The
Duff</i> swung round under a gentle breeze into Matavai<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Bay and dropped anchor. But before she could even
anchor the whole bay had become alive with Tahitians.
They thronged the beach, and, leaping into canoes, sent
them skimming across the bay to the ship.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson, scanning the canoes swiftly and
anxiously, saw with relief that the men were not armed.
But the missionaries were startled when the savages
climbed up the sides of the ship, and with wondering
eyes rolling in their wild heads peered over the rail of
the deck. They then leapt on board and began dancing
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>like mad on the deck with their bare feet. From the
canoes the Tahitians hauled up pigs, fowl, fish, bananas,
and held them for the white men to buy. But Captain
Wilson and all his company would not buy on that day&mdash;for
it was Sunday.</p>

<p>The missionaries gathered together on deck to hold
their Sunday morning service. The Tahitians stopped
dancing and looked on with amazement, as the company
of white men with their children knelt to pray and then
read from the Bible.</p>

<p>The Tahitians could not understand this strange
worship, with no god that could be seen. But when the
white fathers and mothers and children sang, the savages
stood around with wonder and delight on their
faces as they listened to the strange and beautiful
sounds.</p>

<p>But the startling events of the day were not over.
For out from the beach came a canoe across the bay,
and in it two Swedish sailors, named, like some fishermen
of long ago, Peter and Andrew. These white men
knew some English, but lived, not as Christians, but as
the natives lived.</p>

<p>And after them came a great and aged chief named
Haamanemane.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This great chief went up to the
"chief" of the ship, Captain Wilson, and called out to
him "Taio."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>They did not know what this meant, till Peter the
Swede explained that Haamanemane wished to be the
brother&mdash;the troth-friend of Captain Wilson. They
were even to change names. Captain Wilson would be
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>called Haamanemane, and Haamanemane would be
called Wilson.</p>

<p>So Captain Wilson said "Taio," and he and the chief,
who was also high priest of the gods of Tahiti, were
brothers.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson said to Haamanemane, through
Peter, who translated each to the other:</p>

<p>"We wish to come and live in this island."</p>

<p>Haamanemane said that he would speak to the king
and queen of Tahiti about it. So he got down again
over the side of the vessel into the canoe, and the paddles
of his boatman flashed as they swept along over the
breakers to the beach to tell the king of the great white
chief who had come to visit them.</p>

<p>All these things happened on the Sunday. On Tuesday
word came that the king and the queen would receive
them. So Captain Wilson and all his missionaries
got into the whale-boat and pulled for the shore. The
natives rushed into the water, seized the boat and
hauled her aground out of reach of the great waves.</p>

<p>They were startled to see the king and queen come
riding on the shoulders of men. Even when one bearer
grew tired and the king or the queen must get upon
another, they were not allowed to touch the ground.
The reason was that all the land they touched became
their own, and the people carried them about so that
they themselves might not lose their land and houses
by the king and queen touching them.</p>

<p>So at that place, under the palm trees of Tahiti, with
the beating of the surf on the shore before them, and
the great mountain forests behind, these brown island<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>ers
of the South Seas gave a part of their land to Captain
Wilson and his men that they might live there.</p>

<p>The sons of the wild men of the North Sea Islands
had met their first great adventure in bringing to the
men of the South Sea Islands the story of the love of
the Father of all.</p>

<h4>THE ISLAND BEACON FIRES</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Papeiha</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident, 1823)</p>


<p>The edge of the sea was just beginning to gleam with
the gold of the rising sun. The captain of a little ship,
that tossed and rolled on the tumbling ocean, looked out
anxiously over the bow. Around him everywhere was
the wild waste of the Pacific Ocean. Through day
after day he had tacked and veered, baffled by contrary
winds. Now, with little food left in the ship, starvation
on the open ocean stared them in the face.</p>

<p>They were searching for an island of which they had
heard, but which they had never seen.</p>

<p>The captain searched the horizon again, but he saw
nothing, except that ahead of him, on the sky-line to
the S.W., great clouds had gathered. He turned round
and went to the master-missionary&mdash;the hero and explorer
and shipbuilder, John Williams, saying:</p>

<p>"We must give up the search or we shall all be
starved."</p>

<p>John Williams knew that this was true; yet he hated
the thought of going back. He was a scout exploring
at the head of God's navy. He had left his home in
London and with his young wife had sailed across the
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>world to the South Seas to carry the Gospel of Jesus
Christ to the people there. He was living on the island
of Raiatea: but as he himself said, "I cannot be confined
within the limits of a single reef." He wanted
to pass on the torch to other islands. So he was now
on this voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>It was seven o'clock when the captain told John
Williams that they must give up the search.</p>

<p>"In an hour's time," said Williams, "we will turn
back if we have not sighted Rarotonga."</p>

<p>So they sailed on. The sun climbed the sky, the cool
dawn was giving way to the heat of day.</p>

<p>"Go up the mast and look ahead," said Williams to a
South Sea Island native. Then he paced the deck, hoping
to hear the cry of "Land," but nothing could the
native see.</p>

<p>"Go up again," cried Williams a little later. And
again there was nothing. Four times the man climbed
the mast, and four times he reported only sea and sky
and cloud. Gradually the sun's heat had gathered up
the great mountains of cloud, and the sky was clear to
the edge of the ocean. Then there came a sudden cry
from the masthead:</p>

<p>"Teie teie, taua fenua, nei!"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>"Here, here is the land we have been seeking."</p>

<p>All rushed to the bows. As the ship sailed on and
they came nearer, they saw a lovely island. Mountains,
towering peak on peak, with deep green valleys between
brown rocky heights hung with vines, and the great
ocean breakers booming in one white line of foaming
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>surf on the reef of living coral, made it look like a
vision of fairyland.</p>

<p>They had discovered Rarotonga.</p>

<p>But what of the people of the island?</p>

<p>They were said to be cannibals.</p>

<p>Would they receive the missionaries with clubs and
spears? Who would go ashore?</p>

<p>On board the ship were brown South Sea men from
the island where John Williams lived. They had
burned their idols, and now they too were missionaries
of Jesus Christ. Their leader was a fearless young
man, Papeiha. He was so daring that once, when
everybody else was afraid to go from the ship to a cannibal
island, he bound his Bible in his loin cloth, tied
them to the top of his head, and swam ashore, defying
the sharks, and unafraid of the still more cruel islanders.</p>

<p>So at Rarotonga, when the call came, "Who will go
ashore?" and a canoe was let down from the ship's side,
two men, Papeiha and his friend Vahineino,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> leapt into
it. Those two fearlessly paddled towards the shore,
which was now one brown stretch of Rarotongans
crowded together to see this strange ship with wings
that had sailed from over the sea's edge.</p>

<p>The Rarotongans seemed friendly; so Papeiha and
Vahineino, who knew the ways of the water from babyhood
and could swim before they could walk, waited for
a great Pacific breaker, and then swept in on her foaming
crest. The canoe grated on the shore. They walked
up the beach under the shade of a grove of trees and
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>said to the Rarotongan king, Makea,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and his people:</p>

<p>"We have come to tell you that many of the islands
of the sea have burned their idols. Once we in those
islands pierced each other with spears and beat each
other to death with clubs; we brutally treated our
women, and the children taken in war were strung together
by their ears like fish on a line. To-day we come&mdash;before
you have destroyed each other altogether in
your wars&mdash;to tell you of the great God, our Father,
who through His Son Jesus Christ has taught us how
to live as brothers."</p>

<p>King Makea said he was pleased to hear these things,
and came in his canoe to the ship to take the other
native teachers on shore with him. The ship stood off
for the night, for the ocean there is too deep for anchorage.</p>

<p>Papeiha and his brown friends, with their wives,
went ashore. Night fell, and they were preparing to
sleep, when, above the thud and hiss of the waves they
heard the noise of approaching crowds. The footsteps
and the talking came nearer, while the little group of
Christians listened intently. At last a chief, carried by
his warriors, came near. He was the fiercest and most
powerful chief on the island.</p>

<p>When he came close to Papeiha and his friends, the
chief demanded that the wife of one of the Christian
teachers should be given to him, so that he might take
her away with him as his twentieth wife. The teachers
argued with the chief, the woman wept; but he ordered
the woman to be seized and taken off. She resisted, as
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>did the others. Their clothes were torn to tatters by
the ferocious Rarotongans. All would have been over
with the Christians, had not Tapairu,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> a brave Rarotongan
woman and the cousin of the king, opposed the
chiefs and even fought with her hands to save the
teacher's wife. At last the fierce chief gave in, and
Papeiha and his friends, before the sun had risen, hurried
to the beach, leapt into their canoe and paddled
swiftly to the ship.</p>

<p>"We must wait and come to this island another day
when the people are more friendly," said every one&mdash;except
Papeiha, who never would turn back. "Let me
stay with them," said he.</p>

<p>He knew that he might be slain and eaten by the savage
cannibals on the island. But without fuss, leaving
everything he had upon the ship except his clothes and
his native Testament, he dropped into his canoe, seized
the paddle, and with swift, strong strokes that never
faltered, drove the canoe skimming over the rolling
waves till it leapt to the summit of a breaking wave and
ground upon the shore.</p>

<p>The savages came jostling and waving spears and
clubs as they crowded round him.</p>

<p>"Let us take him to Makea."</p>

<p>So Papeiha was led to the chief. As he walked he
heard them shouting to one another, "I'll have his hat,"
"I'll have his jacket," "I'll have his shirt."</p>

<p>At length he reached the chief, who looked and said,
"Speak to us, O man, that we may know why you persist
in coming."</p>

<p>"I come," he answered, looking round on all the
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>people, "so that you may all learn of the true God, and
that you, like all the people in the far-off islands of the
sea, may take your gods made of wood, of birds' feathers
and of cloth, and burn them."</p>

<p>A roar of anger and horror burst from the people.
"What!" they cried, "burn the gods! What gods
shall we then have? What shall we do without the
gods?"</p>

<p>They were angry, but there was something in the bold
face of Papeiha that kept them from slaying him. They
allowed him to stay, and did not kill him.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Papeiha one day heard shrieking and
shouting and wild roars as of men in a frenzy. He saw
crowds of people round the gods offering food to them;
the priests with faces blackened with charcoal and with
bodies painted with stripes of red and yellow, the warriors
with great waving head-dresses of birds' feathers
and white sea-shells. Papeiha, without taking any
thought of the peril that he rushed into, went into the
midst of the people and said:</p>

<p>"Why do you act so foolishly? Why do you take a
log of wood and carve it, and then offer it food? It is
only fit to be burned. Some day soon you shall make
these very gods fuel for fire." So with the companion
who came to help him, brown Papeiha went in and out
of the island just as brave Paul went in and out in the
island of Cyprus and Wilfrid in Britain. He would
take his stand, now under a grove of bananas on a great
stone, and now in a village, where the people from the
huts gathered round, and again on the beach, where he
would lift up his voice above the boom of the ocean
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>breakers to tell the story of Jesus. And some of those
degraded savages became Christians.</p>

<p>One day he was surprised to see one of the priests
come to him leading his ten-year-old boy.</p>

<p>"Take care of my boy," said the priest. "I am going
to burn my god, and I do not want my god's anger to
hurt the boy. Ask your God to protect him." So the
priest went home.</p>

<p>Next morning quite early, before the heat of the sun
was great, Papeiha looked out and saw the priest tottering
along with bent and aching shoulders. On his
back was his cumbrous wooden god. Behind the priest
came a furious crowd, waving their arms and crying
out:</p>

<p>"Madman, madman, the god will kill you."</p>

<p>"You may shout," answered the priest, "but you will
not change me. I am going to worship Jehovah, the
God of Papeiha." And with that he threw down the
god at the feet of the teachers. One of them ran and
brought a saw, and first cut off its head and then sawed
it into logs. Some of the Rarotongans rushed away
in dread. Others&mdash;even some of the newly converted
Christians&mdash;hid in the bush and peered through the
leaves to see what would happen. Papeiha lit a fire;
the logs were thrown on; the first Rarotongan idol was
burned.</p>

<p>"You will die," cried the priests of the fallen god.
But to show that the god was just a log of wood, the
teachers took a bunch of bananas, placed them on the
ashes where the fire had died down, and roasted them.
Then they sat down and ate the bananas.</p>

<p>The watching, awe-struck people looked to see the
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>teachers fall dead, but nothing happened. The islanders
then began to wonder whether, after all, the God of
Papeiha was not the true God. Within a year they had
got together hundreds of their wooden idols, and had
burned them in enormous bonfires which flamed on the
beach and lighted up the dark background of trees.
Those bonfires could be seen far out across the Pacific
Ocean, like a beacon light.</p>

<p>To-day the flames of love which Papeiha bravely
lighted, through perils by water and club and cannibal
feast, have shone right across the ocean, and some of
the grandchildren of those very Rarotongans who
were cannibals when Papeiha went there, have sailed
away, as we shall see later on, to preach Papeiha's gospel
of the love of God to the far-off cannibal Papuans
on the steaming shores of New Guinea.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>THE DAYBREAK CALL</h4>

<p class='center'><i>John Williams</i><br />
(Date of Incident, 1839)</p>


<p>Two men leaned on the rail of the brig <i>Camden</i> as
she swept slowly along the southern side of the Island
of Erromanga in the Western Pacific. A steady breeze
filled her sails. The sea heaved in long, silky billows.
The red glow of the rising sun was changing to the
full, clear light of morning.</p>

<p>The men, as they talked, scanned the coast-line
closely. There was the grey, stone-covered beach, and,
behind the beach, the dense bush and the waving fronds
of palms. Behind the palms rose the volcanic hills of
the island. The elder man straightened himself and
looked keenly to the bay from which a canoe was
swiftly gliding.</p>

<p>He was a broad, sturdy man, with thick brown hair
over keen watchful eyes. His open look was fearless
and winning. His hands, which grasped the rail, had
both the strength and the skill of the trained mechanic
and the writer. For John Williams could build a ship,
make a boat and sail them both against any man in all
the Pacific. He could work with his hammer at the
forge in the morning, make a table at his joiner's bench
in the afternoon, preach a powerful sermon in the
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>evening, and write a chapter of the most thrilling of
books on missionary travel through the night. Yet next
morning would see him in his ship, with her sails
spread, moving out into the open Pacific, bound for a
distant island.</p>

<p>"It is strange," Williams was saying to his friend
Mr. Cunningham, "but I have not slept all through the
night."</p>

<p>How came it that this man, who for over twenty
years had faced tempests by sea, who had never flinched
before perils from savage men and from fever, on the
shores of a hundred islands in the South Seas, should
stay awake all night as his ship skirted the strange
island of Erromanga?</p>

<p>It was because, having lived for all those years
among the coral islands of the brown Polynesians of
the Eastern Pacific, he was now sailing to the New
Hebrides, where the fierce black cannibal islanders of
the Western Pacific slew one another. As he thought
of the fierce men of Erromanga he thought of the waving
forests of brown hands he had seen, the shouts of
"Come back again to us!" that he had heard as he left
his own islands. He knew how those people loved him
in the Samoan Islands, but he could not rest while
others lay far off who had never heard the story of
Jesus. "I cannot be content," he said, "within the narrow
limits of a single reef."</p>

<p>But the black islanders were wild men who covered
their dark faces with soot and painted their lips with
flaming red, yet their cruel hearts were blacker than
their faces, and their anger more fiery than their scarlet
lips. They were treacherous and violent savages who
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>would smash a skull by one blow with a great club; or
leaping on a man from behind, would cut through his
spine with a single stroke of their tomahawks, and then
drag him off to their cannibal oven.</p>

<p>John Williams cared so much for his work of telling
the islanders about God their Father, that he lay awake
wondering how he could carry it on among these wild
people. It never crossed his mind that he should hold
back to save himself from danger. It was for this
work that he had crossed the world.</p>

<p>"Let down the whale-boat." His voice rang out
without a tremor of fear. His eyes were on the canoe
in which three black Erromangans were paddling across
the bay. As the boat touched the water, he and the
crew of four dropped into her, with Captain Morgan
and two friends, Harris and Cunningham. The oars
dipped and flashed in the morning sun as the whale-boat
flew along towards the canoe. When they reached
it, Williams spoke in the dialects of his other islands,
but none could the three savages in the canoe understand.
So he gave them some beads and fish-hooks as
a present to show that he was a friend and again his
boat shot away toward the beach.</p>

<p>They pulled to a creek where a brook ran down in a
lovely valley between two mountains. On the beach
stood some Erromangan natives, with their eyes (half
fierce, half frightened) looking out under their matted
jungle of hair.</p>

<p>Picking up a bucket from the boat, Williams held it
out to the chief and made signs to show that he wished
for water from the brook. The chief took the bucket,
and, turning, ran up the beach and disappeared. For a
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>quarter of an hour they waited; and for half an hour.
At last, when the sun was now high in the sky, the
chief returned with the water.</p>

<p>Williams drank from the water to show his friendliness.
Then his friend, Harris, swinging himself over
the side of the boat, waded ashore through the cool,
sparkling, shallow water and sat down. The natives
ran away, but soon came back with cocoa-nuts and
opened them for him to drink.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"See," said Williams, "there are boys playing on the
beach; that is a good sign."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Captain Morgan, "but there are no
women, and when the savages mean mischief they send
their women away."</p>

<p>Williams now waded ashore and Cunningham followed
him. Captain Morgan stopped to throw out the
anchor of his little boat and then stepped out and went
ashore, leaving his crew of four brown islanders resting
on their oars.</p>

<p>Williams and his two companions scrambled up the
stony beach over the grey stones and boulders alongside
the tumbling brook for over a hundred yards.
Turning to the right they were lost to sight from the
water-edge. Captain Morgan was just following them
when he heard a terrified yell from the crew in the
boat.</p>

<p>Williams and his friends had gone into the bush,
Harris in front, Cunningham next, and Williams last.
Suddenly Harris, who had disappeared in the bush,
rushed out followed by yelling savages with clubs.
Harris rushed down the bank of the brook, stumbled,
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>and fell in. The water dashed over him, and the Erromangans,
with the red fury of slaughter in their
eyes, leapt in and beat in his skull with clubs.</p>

<p>Cunningham, with a native at his heels with lifted
club, stooped, picked up a great pebble and hurled it
full at the savage who was pursuing him. The man
was stunned. Turning again, Cunningham leapt safely
into the boat.</p>

<p>Williams, leaving the brook, had rushed down the
beach to leap into the sea. Reaching the edge of the
water, where the beach falls steeply into the sea, he
slipped on a pebble and fell into the water.</p>

<p>Cunningham, from the boat, hurled stones at the
natives rushing at Williams, who lay prostrate in the
water with a savage over him with uplifted club. The
club fell, and other Erromangans, rushing in, beat him
with their clubs and shot their arrows into him until the
ripples of the beach ran red with his blood.</p>

<p>The hero who had carried the flaming torch of peace
on earth to the savages on scores of islands across the
great Pacific Ocean was dead&mdash;the first martyr of Erromanga.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When <i>The Camden</i> sailed back to Samoa, scores of
canoes put out to meet her. A brown Samoan guided
the first canoe.</p>

<p>"Missi William," he shouted.</p>

<p>"He is dead," came the answer.</p>

<p>The man stood as though stunned. He dropped
his paddle; he drooped his head, and great tears
welled out from the eyes of this dark islander and
ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>The news spread like wildfire over the islands, and
from all directions came the natives crying in
multitudes:</p>

<p>"Aue,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Williamu, Aue, Tama!" (Alas, Williams,
Alas, our Father!)</p>

<p>And the chief Malietoa,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> coming into the presence of
Mrs. Williams, cried:</p>

<p>"Alas, Williamu, Williamu, our father, our father!
He has turned his face from us! We shall never see
him more! He that brought us the good word of Salvation
is gone! O cruel heathen, they know not what
they did! How great a man they have destroyed!"</p>

<p>John Williams, the torch-bearer of the Pacific, whom
the brown men loved, the great pioneer, who dared
death on the grey beach of Erromanga, sounds a morning
bugle-call to us, a Reveill&egrave; to our slumbering
camps:</p>

<h4>KAPIOLANI, THE HEROINE OF HAWAII</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Kapiolani</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident, 1824)</p>


<p>"P&eacute;l&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the all-terrible, the fire goddess, will hurl
her thunder and her stones, and will slay you," cried
the angry priests of Hawaii.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "You no longer pay
your sacrifices to her. Once you gave her hundreds
of hogs, but now you give nothing. You worship the
new God Jehovah. She, the great P&eacute;l&eacute;, will come upon
you, she and the Husband of Thunder, with the Fire-Thruster,
and the Red-Fire Cloud-Queen, they will destroy
you altogether."</p>

<p>The listening Hawaiians shuddered as they saw the
shaggy priests calling down the anger of P&eacute;l&eacute;. One of
the priests was a gigantic man over six feet five inches
high, whose strength was so terrible that he could leap
at his victims and break their bones by his embrace.</p>

<p>Away there in the volcanic island<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in the centre of
the greatest ocean in the world&mdash;the Pacific Ocean&mdash;they
had always as children been taught to fear the
great goddess.</p>

<p>They were Christians; but they had only been Christians
for a short time, and they still trembled at the
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>name of the goddess P&eacute;l&eacute;, who lived up in the mountains
in the boiling crater of the fiery volcano, and
ruled their island.</p>

<p>Their fathers had told them how she would get
angry, and would pour out red-hot rivers of molten
stone that would eat up all the trees and people and run
hissing into the Pacific Ocean. There to that day was
that river of stone&mdash;a long tongue of cold, hard lava&mdash;stretching
down to the shore of the island, and here
across the trees on the mountain-top could be seen,
even now, the smoke of her anger. Perhaps, after all,
P&eacute;l&eacute; was greater than Jehovah&mdash;she was certainly terrible&mdash;and
she was very near!</p>

<p>"If you do not offer fire to her, as you used to do,"
the priests went on, "she will pour down her fire into
the sea and kill all your fish. She will fill up your fishing
grounds with the pahoehoe<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> (lava), and you will
starve. Great is P&eacute;l&eacute; and greatly to be feared."</p>

<p>The priests were angry because the preaching of the
missionaries had led many away from the worship of
P&eacute;l&eacute; which, of course, meant fewer hogs for themselves;
and now the whole nation on Hawaii, that volcanic
island of the seas, seemed to be deserting her.</p>

<p>The people began to waver under the threats, but a
brown-faced woman, with strong, fearless eyes that
looked out with scorn on P&eacute;l&eacute; priests, was not to be
terrified.</p>

<p>"It is Kapiolani,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the chieftainess," murmured the
people to one another. "She is Christian; will she
forsake Jehovah and return to P&eacute;l&eacute;?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>Only four years before this, Kapiolani had&mdash;according
to the custom of the Hawaiian chieftainesses,
married many husbands, and she had given way to
drinking habits. Then she had become a Christian,
giving up her drinking and sending away all her husbands
save one. She had thrown away her idols and
now taught the people in their huts the story of
Christ.</p>

<p>"P&eacute;l&eacute; is nought," she declared, "I will go to Kilawea,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
the mountain of the fires where the smoke and
stones go up, and P&eacute;l&eacute; shall not touch me. My God,
Jehovah, made the mountain and the fires within it
too, as He made us all."</p>

<p>So it was noised through the island that Kapiolani,
the queenly, would defy P&eacute;l&eacute; the goddess. The priests
threatened her with awful torments of fire from the
goddess; her people pleaded with her not to dare the
fires of Kilawea. But Kapiolani pressed on, and eighty
of her people made up their minds to go with her.
She climbed the mountain paths, through lovely valleys
hung with trees, up and up to where the hard rocky
lava-river cut the feet of those who walked upon it.</p>

<p>Day by day they asked her to go back, and always
she answered, "If I am destroyed you may believe
in P&eacute;l&eacute;; if I live you must all believe in the true God,
Jehovah."</p>

<p>As she drew nearer to the crater she saw the great
cloud of smoke that came up from the volcano and felt
the heat of its awful fires. But she did not draw back.</p>

<p>As she climbed upward she saw by the side of the
path low bushes, and on them beautiful red and yel<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>low
berries, growing in clusters. The berries were like
large currants.</p>

<p>"It is chelo,"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> said the priests, "it is P&eacute;l&eacute;'s berry.
You must not touch them unless we ask her. She will
breathe fire on you."</p>

<p>Kapiolani broke off a branch from one of the bushes
regardless of the horrified faces of the priests. And
she ate the berries, without stopping to ask the goddess
for her permission.</p>

<p>She carried a branch of the berries in her hand. If
she had told them what she was going to do they would
have been frenzied with fear and horror.</p>

<p>Up she climbed until the full terrors of the boiling
crater of Kilawea burst on her sight. Before her an
immense gulf yawned in the shape of the crescent
moon, eight miles in circumference and over a thousand
feet deep. Down in the smoking hollow, hundreds
of feet beneath her, a lake of fiery lava rolled in flaming
waves against precipices of rock. This ever-moving
lake of molten fire is called: "The House of Everlasting
Burning." This surging lake was dotted with tiny
mountain islets, and, from the tops of their little peaks,
pyramids of flame blazed and columns of grey smoke
went up. From some of these little islands streams of
blazing lava rolled down into the lake of fire. The air
was filled with the roar of the furnaces of flame.</p>

<p>Even the fearless Kapiolani stood in awe as she
looked. But she did not flinch, though here and there,
as she walked, the crust of the lava cracked under her
feet and the ground was hot with hidden fire.</p>

<p>She came to the very edge of the crater. To come so
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>far without offering hogs and fish to the fiery goddess
was in itself enough to bring a fiery river of molten lava
upon her. Kapiolani offered nothing save defiance.
Audacity, they thought, could go no further.</p>

<p>Here, a priestess of P&eacute;l&eacute; came, and raising her hands
in threat denounced death on the head of Kapiolani if
she came further. Kapiolani pulled from her robe a
book. In it&mdash;for it was her New Testament&mdash;she read
to the priestess of the one true, loving Father-God.</p>

<p>Then Kapiolani did a thing at which the very limbs
of those who watched trembled and shivered. She went
to the edge of the crater and stepped over onto a jutting
rock and let herself down and down toward the
sulphurous burning lake. The ground cracked under
her feet and sulphurous steam hissed through crevices
in the rock, as though the demons of P&eacute;l&eacute; fumed in
their frenzy. Hundreds of staring, wondering eyes
followed her, fascinated and yet horrified.</p>

<p>Then she stood on a ledge of rock, and, offering up
prayer and praise to the God of all, Who made the
volcano and Who made her, she cast the P&eacute;l&eacute; berries
into the lake, and sent stone after stone down into the
flaming lava. It was the most awful insult that could
be offered to P&eacute;l&eacute;! Now surely she would leap up in
fiery anger, and, with a hail of burning stones, consume
Kapiolani. But nothing happened; and Kapiolani,
turning, climbed the steep ascent of the crater
edge and at last stood again unharmed among her people.
She spoke to her people, telling them again that
Jehovah made the fires. She called on them all to sing
to His praise and, for the first time, there rang across
the crater of Kilawea the song of Christians. The
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>power of the priests was gone, and from that hour the
people all over that island who had trembled and hesitated
between P&eacute;l&eacute; and Christ turned to the worship of
our Lord Jesus, the Son of God the Father Almighty.</p>

<h4>THE CANOE OF ADVENTURE</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Elikana</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident, 1861)</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"I know not where His islands lift<br /></span>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Manihiki Island looked like a tiny anchored canoe far
away across the Pacific, as Elikana glanced back from
his place at the tiller. He sang, meantime, quietly to
himself an air that still rang in his ears, the tune that
he and his brother islanders had sung in praise of the
Power and Providence of God at the services on Manihiki.
For the Christian people of the Penrhyn group
of South Sea Islands had come together in April, 1861,
for their yearly meeting, paddling from the different
quarters in their canoes through the white surge of the
breakers that thunder day and night round the island.</p>

<p>Elikana looked ahead to where his own island of
Rakahanga grew clearer every moment on the sky-line
ahead of them, though each time his craft
dropped into the trough of the sea between the green
curves of the league-long ocean rollers the island was
lost from sight.</p>

<p><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>He and his six companions were sailing back over
the thirty miles between Manihiki and Rakahanga,
two of the many little lonely ocean islands that stud
the Pacific like stars.</p>

<p>They sailed a strange craft, for it cannot be called
raft or canoe or hut. It was all these and yet was
neither. Two canoes, forty-eight feet long, sailed side
by side. Between the canoes were spars, stretching
across from one to the other, lashed to each boat and
making a platform between them six feet wide. On
this was built a hut, roofed with the beautiful braided
leaves of the cocoa-nut palm.</p>

<p>Overhead stretched the infinite sky. Underneath lay
thousands of fathoms of blue-green ocean, whose cold,
hidden deeps among the mountains and valleys of the
awful ocean under-world held strange goblin fish-shapes.
And on the surface this hut of leaves and bamboo
swung dizzily between sky and ocean on the frail
canoes. And in the canoes and the hut were six brown
Rakahangan men, two women, and a chubby, dark-eyed
child, who sat contented and tired, being lapped to
sleep by the swaying waters.</p>

<p>Above them the great sail made of matting of fibre,
strained in the breeze that drove them nearer to the
haven where they would be. Already they could see
the gleam of the Rakahanga beach with the rim of silver
where the waves broke into foam. Then the breeze
dropped. The fibre-sail flapped uneasily against the
mast, while the two little canvas sails hung loosely, as
the wind, with little warning, swung round, and smiting
them in the face began to drive them back into the
ocean again.</p>

<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>Elikana and his friends knew the sea almost like fish,
from the time they were babies. And they were little
troubled by the turn of the breeze, save that it would
delay their homecoming. They tried in vain to make
headway. Slowly, but surely they were driven back
from land, till they could see that there was no other
thing but just to turn about and let her run back to
Manihiki. In the canoes were enough cocoa-nuts to
feed them for days if need be, and two large calabashes
of water.</p>

<p>The swift night fell, but the wind held strong, and
one man sat at the tiller while two others baled out the
water that leaked into the canoes. They kept a keen
watch, expecting to sight Manihiki; but when the dawn
flashed out of the sky in the East, where the island
should have been, there was neither Manihiki nor any
other land at all. They had no chart nor compass;
north and south and east and west stretched the wastes
of the Pacific for hundreds of leagues. Only here and
there in the ocean, and all unseen to them, like little
groups of mushrooms on a limitless prairie, lay groups
of islets.</p>

<p>They might, indeed, sail for a year without ever
sighting any land; and one storm-driven wave of the
great ocean could smite their little egg-shell craft to
the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>They gathered together in the hut and with anxious
faces talked of what they might do. They knew that
far off to the southwest lay the islands of Samoa, and
Rarotonga. So they set the bows of their craft southward.
Morning grew to blazing noon and fell to evening
and night, and nothing did they see save the glit<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>tering
sparkling waters of the uncharted ocean, cut
here and there by the cruel fin of a waiting shark. It
was Saturday when they started; and night fell seven
times while their wonderful hut-boat crept southward
along the water, till the following Friday. Then the
wind changed, and, springing up from the south, drove
them wearily back once more in their tracks, and then
bore them eastward.</p>

<p>For another week they drove before the breeze, feeding
on the cocoa-nuts. But the water in the calabashes
was gone. Then on the morning of the second Friday,
the fourteenth day of their sea-wanderings, just when
the sun in mid heaven was blazing its noon-heat upon
them and most of the little crew were lying under the
shade of the hut and the sail to doze away the hours
of tedious hunger, they heard the cry of "Land!" and
leaping to their feet gazed ahead at the welcome sight.
With sail and paddle they urged the craft on toward
the island.</p>

<p>Then night fell, and with it squalls of wind and rain
came and buffeted them till they had to forsake the paddles
for the bailing-vessels to keep the boat afloat.
Taking down the sails they spread them flat to catch
the pouring rain, and then poured this precious fresh
water&mdash;true water of life to them&mdash;into their calabashes.
But when morning came no land could be
seen anywhere. It was as though the island had been
a land of enchantment and mirage, and now had faded
away. Yet hope sprang in them erect and glad next
day when land was sighted again; but the sea and the
wind, as though driven by the spirits of contrariness,
smote them back.</p>

<p><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>For two more days they guided the canoe with the
tiller and tried to set her in one steady direction. Then,
tired and out of heart, after sixteen days of ceaseless
and useless effort, they gave it up and let her drift, for
the winds and currents to take her where they would.</p>

<p>At night each man stood in his canoe almost starving
and parched with thirst, with aching back, stooping to
dip the water from the canoe and rising to pour it
over the side. For hour after hour, while the calm
moon slowly climbed the sky, each slaved at his dull
task. Lulled by the heave and fall of the long-backed
rollers as they slid under the keels of the canoes, the
men nearly dropped asleep where they stood. The quiet
waters crooned to them like a mother singing an old
lullaby&mdash;crooned and called, till a voice deep within
them said, "It is better to lie down and sleep and die
than to live and fight and starve."</p>

<p>Then a moan from the sleeping child, or a sight of a
streaming ray of moonlight on the face of its mother
would send that nameless Voice shivering back to its
deep hiding-place&mdash;and the man would stoop and bail
again.</p>

<p>Each evening as it fell saw their anxious eyes looking
west and north and south for land, and always there
was only the weary waste of waters. And as the sun
rose, they hardly dared open their eyes to the unbroken
rim of blue-grey that circled them like a steel prison.
They saw the thin edge of the moon grow to full blaze
and then fade to a corn sickle again as days and nights
grew to weeks and a whole month had passed.</p>

<p>Every morning, as the pearl-grey sea turned to pink
and then to gleaming blue, they knelt on the raft be<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>tween
the canoes and turned their faces up to their
Father in prayer, and never did the sun sink behind
the rim of waters without the sound of their voices
rising into the limitless sky with thanks for safe-keeping.</p>

<p>Slowly the pile of cocoa-nuts lessened. Each one of
them with its sweet milk and flesh was more precious to
them than a golden chalice set with rubies. The drops
of milk that dripped from them were more than ropes
of pearls.</p>

<p>At last eight Sundays had followed one upon another;
and now at the end of the day there was only the
half of one cocoa-nut remaining. When that was gone&mdash;all
would be over. So they knelt down under the
cloudless sky on an evening calm and beautiful. They
were on that invisible line in the Great Pacific where
the day ends and begins. Those seven on the tiny craft
were, indeed, we cannot but believe, the last worshippers
in all the great world-house of God as Sunday
drew to its end just where they were. Was it to be
the last time that they would pray to God in this life?</p>

<p>Prayer ended; night was falling. Elikana the leader,
who had kept their spirits from utterly failing, stood
up and gazed out with great anxious eyes before the
last light should fail.</p>

<p>"Look, there upon the edge of the sea where the sun
sets. Is it&mdash;" He could hardly dare to believe that
it was not the mirage of his weary brain. But one and
another and then all peered out through the swiftly
waning light and saw that indeed it was land.</p>

<p>Then a squall of wind sprang up, blowing them away
from the land. Was this last hope, by a fine ecstasy of
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>torture, to be dangled before them and then snatched
away? But with the danger came the help; with the
wind came the rain; cool, sweet, refreshing, life-giving
water. Then the squall of wind dropped and changed.
They hoisted the one sail that had not blown to tatters,
and drove for land.</p>

<p>Yet their most awful danger still lay before them.
The roar of the breakers on the cruel coral reef caught
their ears. But there was nothing for it but to risk the
peril. They were among the breakers which caught and
tossed them on like eggshells. The scourge of the surf
swept them; a woman, a man&mdash;even the child, were torn
from them and ground on the ghastly teeth of the coral.
Five were swept over with the craft into the still, blue
lagoon, and landing they fell prone upon the shore, just
breathing and no more, after the giant buffeting of
the thundering rollers, following the long, slow starvation
of their wonderful journey in the hut on the
canoes among "the waters of the wondrous isles."</p>

</div></div>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Thrown up by the ocean in the darkness like driftwood,
Elikana and his companions lay on the grey
shore. Against the dim light of the stars and beyond
the beach of darkness they could see the fronds of the
palms waving. The five survivors were starving, and
the green cocoa-nuts hung above them, filled with food
and drink. But their bodies, broken and tormented as
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>they were by hunger and the battering breakers, refused
even to rise and climb for the food that meant
life. So they lay there, as though dead.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Over the ridge of the beach came a man. His pale
copper skin shone in the fresh sunlight of the morning.
His quick black eyes were caught by the sight of
torn clothing hanging on a bush. Moving swiftly down
the beach of pounded coral, he saw a man lying with
arms thrown out, face downward. Turning the body
over Faivaatala<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> found that the man was dead. Taking
the body in his arms he staggered with it up the
beach, and placed it under the shade of the trees. Returning
he found the living five. Their gaunt bodies
and the broken craft on the shore told him without
words the story of their long drifting over the wilderness
of the waters.</p>

<p>Without stopping to waste words in empty sympathy
with starving men, Faivaatala ran to the nearest cocoa-nut
tree and, climbing it, threw down luscious nuts.
Those below quickly knocked off the tops, drank deep
draughts of the cool milk and then ate. Coming down
again, Faivaatala kindled a fire and soon had some
fish grilling for these strange wanderers thrown up on
the tiny islet.</p>

<p>They had no time to thank him before he ran off
and swiftly paddled to Motutala, the island where he
lived, to tell the story of these strange castaways. He
came back with other helpers in canoes, and the five
getting aboard were swiftly paddled to Motutala.</p>

<p>As the canoes skimmed over the surface of the great
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>lagoon Elikana and his friends could see, spread out in
a great semi-circle that stretched to the horizon, the
long low coral islets crowned with palms which form
part of the Ellice Islands.</p>

<p>The islanders, men, women, and children, ran down
the beach to see the newcomers and soon had set apart
huts for them and made them welcome. Elikana gathered
them round him, and began to tell them about the
love of Jesus and the protecting care of God the
Father. It all seemed strange to them, but quickly they
learned from him, and he began to teach them and their
children. This went on for four months, till one day
Elikana said: "I must go away and learn more so that
I can teach you more."</p>

<p>But they had become so fond of Elikana that they
said: "No, you must not leave us," and it was only
when he promised to come back with another teacher to
help him, that they could bring themselves to part with
him. So when a ship came to the island to trade in
cocoa-nuts Elikana went aboard and sailed to Samoa
to the London Missionary Society's training college
there at Malua.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"A ship! A ship!" The cry was taken up through
the island, and the people running down the beach saw
a large sailing vessel. Boats put down and sculls
flashed as sailors pulled swiftly to the shore.</p>

<p>They landed and the people gathered round to see
and to hear what they would say.</p>

<p>"Come onto our ship," said these men, who had
sailed there from Peru, "and we will show you how
you can be rich with many knives and much calico."</p>

<p><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>But the islanders shook their heads and said they
would stay where they were. Then a wicked white man
named Tom Rose, who lived on the island and knew
how much the people were looking forward to the day
when Elikana would come back to teach them, went to
the traders and whispered what he knew to them.</p>

<p>So the Peruvian traders, with craft shining in their
eyes, turned again to the islanders and said: "If you
will come with us, we will take you where you will be
taught all that men can know about God."</p>

<p>At this the islanders broke out into glad cries and
speaking to one another said: "Let us go and learn
these things."</p>

<p>The day came for sailing, and as the sun rose, hundreds
of brown feet were running to the beach, children
dancing with excitement, women saying "Goodbye"
to their husbands&mdash;men, who for the first time
in all their lives were to leave their tiny islet for the
wonderful world beyond the ocean.</p>

<p>So two hundred of them went on board. The sails
were hoisted and they went away never to return;
sailed away not to learn of Jesus, but to the sting of
the lash and the shattering bullet, the bondage of the
plantations, and to death at the hands of those merciless
beasts of prey, the Peruvian slavers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Years passed and a little fifty-ton trading vessel came
to anchor outside the reef. One man and then another
and another got down into the little boat and pulled
for the shore. Elikana had returned. The women and
children ran down to meet him&mdash;but few men were
there, for nearly all had gone.</p>

<p><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>"Where is this one? Where is the other?" cried
Elikana, with sad face as he looked around on them.</p>

<p>"Gone, gone," came the answer; "carried away by
the man-stealing ships."</p>

<p>Elikana turned to the white missionary who had
come with him, to ask what they could do.</p>

<p>"We will leave Joane and his wife here," replied Mr.
Murray.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>So a teacher from Samoa stayed there and taught the
people, while Elikana went to begin work in an island
near by.</p>

<p>To-day a white lady missionary has gone to live
in the Ellice Islands, and the people are Christians, and
no slave-trader can come to snatch them away.</p>

<p>So there sailed over the waters of the wondrous isles
first the boat of sunrise and then the ship of darkness,
and last of all the ship of the Peace of God. The ship
of darkness had seemed for a time to conquer, but
her day is now over; and to-day on that beach, as the
sunlight brims over the edge of the sea, and a new
Lord's Day dawns, you may hear the islanders sing
their praise to the Light of the World, Who shines
upon them and keeps them safe.</p>

<h4>THE ARROWS OF SANTA CRUZ</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Bishop Patteson</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident&mdash;August 15th, 1864)</p>


<p>The brown crew of <i>The Southern Cross</i> breathed
freely again as the anchor swung into place and the
schooner began to nose her way out into the open
Pacific. They were hardened to dangers, but the Island
of Tawny Cannibals had strained their nerve, by
its hourly perils from club and flying arrow. The men
were glad to see their ship's bows plunge freely again
through the long-backed rollers.</p>

<p>As they set her course to the Island of Santa Cruz
the crew talked together of the men of the island they
had left. In his cabin sat a great bronzed bearded man
writing a letter to his own people far away on the other
side of the world. Here are the very words that he
wrote as he told the story of one of the dangers through
which they had just passed on the island:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As I sat on the beach with a crowd about me, most
of them suddenly jumped up and ran off. Turning my
head I saw a man (from the boat they saw two) coming
to me with club uplifted. I remained sitting and
held out a few fish-hooks to him, but one or two men
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>jumped up and, seizing him by the waist, forced him
off.</p>

<p>"After a few minutes I went back to the boat. I
found out that a poor fellow called Moliteum was shot
dead two months ago by a white trader for stealing a
bit of calico. The wonder was, not that they wanted to
avenge the death of their kinsman, but that others
should have prevented it. How could they possibly
know that I was not one of the wicked set? Yet they
did.... The plan of going among the people unarmed
makes them regard me as a friend."</p></div>

<p>Then he says of these men who had just tried to kill
him: "The people, though constantly fighting, and
cannibals and the rest of it, are to me very attractive."</p>

<p>The ship sailed on till they heard ahead of them the
beating of the surf on the reef of Santa Cruz. Behind
the silver line of the breakers the waving fronds of her
palms came into sight. They put <i>The Southern Cross</i>
in, cast anchor, and let a boat down from her side.
Into the boat tumbled a British sailor named Pearce, a
young twenty-year-old Englishman named Atkin, and
three brown South-Sea Island boys from the missionary
training college for native teachers on Norfolk Island,
and their leader, Bishop Patteson, the white man
who, having faced the clubs of savages on a score of
islands, never flinched from walking into peril again
to lead them to know of "the best Man in the world,
Jesus Christ." These brown boys were young helpers
of Bishop Patteson. And one of them especially,
Fisher Young, would have died for his great white
leader gladly. They were like father and son.</p>

<p><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>The reef, covered at mid-tide with curling waters
mottled with the foam of the broken waves, was alive
with men; while the beach beyond was black with
crowds of the wild islanders who had come down to see
the strange visitors from the ship. The four men
sculled the boat on to the edge of the reef and then
rested on their oars as Patteson swung himself over the
side into the cool water. He waded across the reef
between the hosts of savages, and in every hand was a
club or spear or a six-foot wooden bow with an arrow
ready to notch in its bamboo string.</p>

<p>Patteson had come to make friends with them. So
he entered a dark wattled house and sat down to talk.
The doorway was filled with the faces of wondering
men. As he looked on them a strange gleam of longing
came into his eyes and a smile of great tenderness softened
the strength of his brown face&mdash;the longing and
the tenderness of a shepherd looking for wandering
sheep who are lost on the wild mountains of the world.</p>

<p>Then he rose, left the house, and went back to the
boat. The water was now one seething cauldron of
men&mdash;walking, splashing, swimming. Some, as Patteson
climbed into his boat, caught hold of the gunwale
and could hardly be made to loosen their hold. The
four young fellows in the boat swung their oars and
got her under way, but they had made barely half a
dozen strokes when, without warning, an arrow
whizzed through the air into the boat. A cloud of arrows
followed.</p>

<p>Six canoes were now filled with savage Santa Cruzans,
who surrounded the boat and joined in the shooting.
Patteson, who was in the stern between his boys
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>and the bowmen, had not shipped the rudder, so he
held it up, as the boat shot ahead of the canoes, to
shield off arrows.</p>

<p>Turning round to see whither his now rudderless
boat was being pulled, he saw that they were heading
for a little bay in the reef, which would have wrecked
their hopes of safety.</p>

<p>"Pull, port oars, pull on steadily," shouted Patteson;
and they made for <i>The Southern Cross</i>.</p>

<p>As he called to them he saw Pearce, the young British
sailor, lying between the thwarts with the long shaft
of an arrow in his chest, and a young Norfolk Islander
with an arrow under his left eye. The arrows flew
around them in clouds, and suddenly Fisher Young&mdash;the
nineteen-year-old Polynesian whom he loved as a
son&mdash;who was pulling stroke, gave a faint scream. He
was shot through the left wrist.</p>

<p>"Look out, sir! close to you," cried one of his crew.
But the arrows were all around him. All the way to
the schooner the canoes skimmed over the water chasing
the boat. The four youths, including the wounded,
pulled on bravely and steadily. At last they reached
the ship and climbed on board, while the canoes&mdash;fearing
vengeance from the men on the schooner&mdash;turned
and fled.</p>

<p>Once aboard, Bishop Patteson knelt by the side of
Pearce, drew out the arrow which had run more than
five inches deep into his chest, and bound up his
wound. Turning to Fisher, he found that the arrow
had gone through the wrist and had broken off in the
wound. Taking hold of the point of the arrow where
it stood out on the lower side of the wrist, Patteson
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>pulled it through, though the agony of the boy was
very great.</p>

<p>The arrows were wooden-headed and not poisoned.
The wounds seemed to be healing, but a few days later
Fisher said, "I can't make out what makes my jaws
feel so stiff."</p>

<p>Fisher Young was the grandson of fierce, foul Pitcairn
Island cannibals, and was himself a brave and
pure Christian lad. He had faced death with his master
many times on coral reefs, in savage villages, on
wild seas and under the clubs of Pacific islanders. Now
he was face to face with something more difficult than
a swift and dangerous adventure&mdash;the slow, dying
agony of lockjaw. He grew steadily worse in spite of
everything that Patteson could do.</p>

<p>Near to the end he said faintly, "Kiss me; I am very
glad I was doing my duty. Tell my father that I was
in the path of duty, and he will be so glad. Poor
Santa Cruz people!"</p>

<p>He spoke in that way of the people who had killed
him. The young brown hero lies to-day, as he would
have wished, in the port that was named after the
Bishop whom he loved, and who was his hero, Port
Patteson.</p>

<p>"I loved him," said Patteson, "as I think I never
loved anyone else." Fisher's love to his Bishop had
been that of a youth to the hero whom he worships,
but Patteson had led that brown islander still further,
for he had taught the boy to love the Hero of all heroes,
Jesus Christ.</p>

<h4>FIVE KNOTS IN A PALM LEAF</h4>

<p class='center'><i>The Death of Patteson</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident, September 20th, 1871)</p>


<p>The masts of the schooner <i>The Southern Cross</i>
swung gently to and fro across the darkening sky as
the long, calm rollers of the Pacific slipped past her
hull. Her bows spread only a ripple of water as the
slight breeze bore her slowly towards the island of
Nukapu.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>On deck stood a group of men, their brown faces
turned to a tall, bearded man. As the light of the setting
sun gleamed on his bronze face, it kindled his
brave eyes and showed the grave smile that played
about the corners of his mouth. They all looked on
him with that worship which strong men give to a
hero, who can be both brave and kindly. But "he wist
not that his face shone" for them.</p>

<p>Patteson read to these young men from a Book; and
the words that he read were these: "And they stoned
Stephen, calling upon God and saying, 'Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit.' And he knelt down and cried, with
a loud voice, 'Lord, lay not this sin to their charge';
and when he had said this, he fell asleep."</p>

<p>When he had spoken to them strongly on these
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>words and said how it may come to any man who worships
Jesus to suffer so, Bishop Patteson and all except
the man on watch went to their sleep. The South
Sea Island men and the young Englishman who were
there remembered all their lives what Patteson had
said that evening; partly because these men themselves
had seen him brave such a death as Stephen's again
and again, and, indeed, they had themselves stood in
peril by his side face to face with threatening savages,
but even more because of the adventure that came to
them on the next day.</p>

<p>At dawn they sighted land, and by eleven o'clock
they were so near that they could see, shimmering in
the heat of the midsummer sun, the white beach of
coral sand and the drooping palms that make all the
island of Nukapu green.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Looking out under their
hands to the island, the men aboard <i>The Southern Cross</i>
could see four great canoes, with their sails set, hovering
like hawks about the circling reef which lay between
them and the island. On the reef the blue waves
beat and broke into a gleaming line of cool white foam.</p>

<p>The slight breeze was hardly strong enough to help
the ship to make the island. It was as though she
knew the danger of that day and would not carry Patteson
and his men into the perils that lay hidden behind
the beauty of that island of Nukapu.</p>

<p>Patteson knew the danger. He knew that, but a
little time before their visit, white men had come in a
ship, had let down their boats and rowed to the men of
the island, had pretended to make friends, and then,
shooting some and capturing others, had sped back to
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>the ship, carrying off the captives to work for them on
the island of Fiji. The law of the savages of the
islands was "Blood for blood." And to them all white
men belonged to one tribe. The peril that lay before
Patteson was that they might attack him in revenge for
the foul crime of those white traders.</p>

<p>Just before noon the order was given to lower a boat
from <i>The Southern Cross</i>. Patteson went down into
it, and sat in the stern, while Mr. Atkin (his English
helper), Stephen Taroniara, James Minipa, and John
Nonono came with him to row. The boat swung
toward the reef. Between the reef and the island lay
two miles of the blue and glittering lagoon.</p>

<p>By the time the boat reached the reef six canoes full
of warriors had come together there. The tide was not
high enough to float the boat across the reef. The
Nukapuan natives said they would haul the boat up
on to the reef, but the Bishop did not think it wise to
consent. Then two of the savages said to "Bisipi," as
they called the Bishop:</p>

<p>"Will you come into our canoe?"</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation, knowing that confidence
was the best way to win them, he stepped into
the canoe. As he entered they gave him a basket with
yams and other fruit in it.</p>

<p>As the tide was low, the Bishop and the savages were
obliged to wade over the reef, dragging the canoe
across to the deeper lagoon within. The boat's crew of
<i>The Southern Cross</i> stopped in the outer sea, drifting
on the tide with the other four Nukapu canoes. They
watched the Bishop cross the lagoon in the canoe and
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>land far off upon the beach. Then he went from their
sight.</p>

<p>The brown men and the white man in the boat were
trying to talk to the islanders in the remaining canoes
outside the reef, when suddenly a savage jumped up in
the nearest canoe, not ten yards from them, and called
out in his native language:</p>

<p>"Have you anything like this?"</p>

<p>He drew his bow to his ear and shot a yard arrow.
His companions in the other canoes leapt to their feet
and sent showers of arrows whizzing at the men in
the boat, shouting as they aimed:</p>

<p>"This for New Zealand man, this for Bernu man,
this for Motu man."</p>

<p>Pulling away with all their speed, Patteson's men
were soon out of range, but an arrow had nailed John
Nonono's cap to his head. Stephen lay in the bottom
of the boat with six arrows in his chest and shoulders.
Mr. Atkin, the white man, had one in his left shoulder.</p>

<p>They reached the ship and were helped on board.
The arrow head was drawn out from Mr. Atkin's
shoulder, and was found to be made of a sharpened
human bone. No sooner was the arrow head out than
Mr. Atkin leapt back into the boat, insisting on going
back to find Patteson. He alone knew how and where
the reef could be crossed on the tide that was now
rising.</p>

<p>So they got a boat's crew from the ship, put a beaker
full of water and some food in the boat, and pulled
toward the reef.</p>

<p>At half-past four the tide was high enough to carry
them across, and they rowed over, looking through their
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>glasses anxiously at the white shore which was lined
with brown figures. A canoe rowed out towards them
bringing another canoe in tow. As the boat went
towards the island, one canoe cast off the other, and
went back; the second canoe drifted towards them
slowly on the still waters of the blue lagoon.</p>

<p>As it came nearer they saw that in the middle of it
lay Something motionless, covered with matting. They
pulled alongside, leaned over the canoe, and lifted into
their boat&mdash;the body of Patteson. The empty canoe
now drifted away.</p>

<p>A yell went up from the savages on the shore. The
boat was pulled towards the ship and then the body
lifted up and laid on the deck. It had been rolled in the
native matting as a shroud, tied at the head and feet.
They unrolled the mat, and there on the face of the
dead Bishop was still that wonderful, patient and winning
smile, as of one who at the moment when his head
was beneath the uplifted club said, "Lord, lay not this
sin to their charge," and had then fallen asleep.</p>

<p>There was a palm leaf fastened over his breast. In
its long leaflets five knots were made. On the body, in
the head, the side, and the legs were five wounds. And
five men in Fiji were at work in the plantations&mdash;men
captured from Nukapu by brutal white traders.</p>

<p>It was the vengeance of the savage&mdash;the call of
"blood for blood"; and the death of Patteson lies surely
upon the head of those white traders who carried death
and captivity to the white coral shore of Nukapu.</p>

<h4>THE BOY OF THE ADVENTUROUS HEART</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Chalmers, the Boy</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Born 1841, martyred 1901)</p>


<p>The rain had poured down in such torrents that even
the hardy boys of Inverary in Scotland had been driven
indoors. Now the sky had cleared, and the sun was
shining again after the great storm. The boys were
out again, and a group of them were walking toward
the little stream of Aray which tumbled through the
glen down to Loch Fyne. But the stream was "little"
no longer.</p>

<p>As the boys came near to the place called "The Three
Bridges," where a rough wooden bridge crossed the
torrent, they walked faster towards the stream, for
they could hear it roaring in a perfect flood which shook
the timbers of the bridge. The great rainfall was running
from the hills through a thousand streamlets into
the main torrent.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a shout and a scream. A boy
dashed toward them saying that one of his schoolmates
had fallen into the rushing water, and that the
full spate of the Aray was carrying him away down to
the sea. The boys stood horrified&mdash;all except one, who
rushed forward, pulling off his jacket as he ran, leapt
down the bank to the lower side of the bridge, and,
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>clinging to the timber, held to it with one arm while he
stretched out the other as the drowning boy was being
carried under the bridge, seized him, and held him
tightly with his left hand.</p>

<p>James Chalmers&mdash;the boy who had gone to the
rescue&mdash;though only ten years old, could swim. Letting
go of the bridge, while still holding the other boy
with one arm, he allowed the current to carry them
both down to where the branches hung over the bank to
the water's surface. Seizing one of these, he dragged
himself and the boy toward the bank, whence he was
helped to dry land by his friends.</p>

<p>The boy whom young James Chalmers had saved
belonged to a rival school. Often the wild-blooded
boys (like their fierce Highland ancestors who fought
clan against clan) had attacked the boys of this school
and had fought them. James, whose father was a stonemason
and whose mother was a Highland lassie born
near Loch Lomond, was the leader in these battles, but
all the fighting was forgotten when he heard that a boy
was in danger of his life, and so he had plunged in as
swiftly to save him as he would have done for any boy
from his own school.</p>

<p>We do not hear that James was clever at lessons in
his school, but when there was anything to be done, he
had the quickest hand, the keenest eye, the swiftest
mind, and the most daring heart in all the village.</p>

<p>Though he loved the hills and glens and the mountain
torrent, James, above everything else, revelled in
the sea. One day a little later on, after the rescue of
his friend from drowning, James stood on the quay
at Inverary gazing across the loch and watching the
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>sails of the fishing boats, when he heard a loud cry.</p>

<p>He looked round. There, on the edge of the quay,
stood a mother wringing her hands and calling out
that her child had fallen into the water and was drowning.
James ran along the quay, and taking off his coat
as he dashed to the spot, he dived into the water and,
seizing the little child by the dress, drew him ashore.
The child seemed dead, but when they laid him on the
quayside, and moved his arms, his breath began to
come and go again and the colour returned to his
cheeks.</p>

<p>Twice Chalmers had saved others from drowning.
Three times he himself, as the result of his daring adventures
in the sea, was carried home, supposed to be
dead by drowning.</p>

<p>At another time he, with two other boys, thrust a
tarred herring-box into the sea from the sandy shore
between the two rocky points where the western sea
came up the narrow Loch Fyne.</p>

<p>"Look at James!" shouted one of the boys to his
companions as Chalmers leapt into the box.</p>

<p>It almost turned over, and he swayed and rolled and
then steadied as the box swung out from the shore.</p>

<p>The other boys, laughing and shouting, towed him
and his boat through the sea as they walked along the
shore. Suddenly, as they talked, they staggered forward.
The cord had snapped and they fell on the sand,
still laughing, but when they stood up again the laughter
died on their lips. James was being swiftly carried out
by the current to sea&mdash;and in a tarred herring-box! He
had no paddle, and his hands were of no effect in trying
to move the boat toward the shore.</p>

<p><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>The boys shouted. There came an answering cry
from the door of a cottage in the village. A fisherman
came swinging down the beach, strode to his boat, took
the two boys into it, and taking an oar himself and
giving the other to the two boys, they pulled out with
the tide. They reached James and rescued him just as
the herring-box was sinking. He went home to the
little cottage where he lived, and his mother gave him
a proper thrashing.</p>

<p>Some of James' schoolfellows used to go on Sundays
to a school in Inverary. He made up his mind to join
them. The class met in the vestry of the United Presbyterian
Church there. After their lesson they went
together into the church to hear a closing address. Mr.
Meikle, the minister, who was also superintendent of
the school, one afternoon took from his pocket a magazine
(a copy of the "Presbyterian Record"). From
this magazine he read a letter from a brave missionary
in the far-off cannibal islands of Fiji. The letter told
of the savage life there and of how, already, the story
of Jesus was leading the men no longer to drag their
victims to the cannibal ovens, nor to pile up the skulls
of their enemies so as to show their own bravery. The
writer said they were beginning happier lives in which
the awful terror of the javelin and the club, and the
horror of demons and witches was gone.</p>

<p>When Mr. Meikle had finished reading the magazine
he folded it up again and then looked round on all the
boys in the school, saying:</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is a boy here this afternoon who
will become a missionary, and by and by bring the
Gospel to other such cannibals as those?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>Even as the minister said those words, the adventurous
heart of young Chalmers leapt in reply as he
said to himself, "Yes, God helping me, I will."</p>

<p>He was just a freckled, dark-haired boy with hazel
eyes, a boy tingling with the joy of the open air and
with the love of the heave and flow of the sea. But
when he made up his mind to do a thing, however great
the difficulties or dangers, James usually carried it
through.</p>

<p>So it came about that some years later in 1866, having
been trained and accepted by the London Missionary
Society, Chalmers, as a young man, walked across
the gangway to a fine new British-built clipper ship.
It had been christened <i>John Williams</i> after the great
hero missionary<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who gave up his life on the beach of
Erromanga.</p>

<p>This boy, who loved the sea and breathed deep with
joy in the face of adventure and peril, had set his face
towards the deep, long breakers of the far-off Pacific.
He was going to carry to the South Seas the story of
the Hero and Saviour Whom he had learnt to love
within the sound of the Atlantic breakers that dashed
and fretted against the rocks of Western Scotland.</p>

<p class='center'><b>THE SCOUT OF PAPUA</b><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>


<p class='center'><i>Chalmers, the Friend</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident, about 1893)</p>


<p>The quick puffing of the steam launch <i>Miro</i> was the
only sound to break the stillness of the mysterious
Aivai<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> River. On the launch were three white people&mdash;two
men and a woman. They were the first who had
ever broken the silence of that stream.</p>

<p>They gazed out under the morning sun along the
dead level of the Purari<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> delta, for they had left behind
them the rolling breakers of the Gulf of Papua in
order to explore this dark river. Away to the south
rolled the blue waters between this vast island of New
Guinea and Northern Australia.</p>

<p>They saw on either bank the wild tangle of twisted
mangroves with their roots higher than a man, twined
together like writhing serpents. They peered through
the thick bush with its green leaves drooping down to
the very water's edge. But mostly they looked ahead
over the bow of the boat along the green-brown water
that lay ahead of them, dappled with sunlight under the
trees. For they were facing an unknown district where
savage Papuans lived&mdash;as wild as hawks. They did
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>not know what adventure might meet them at the next
bend of the river.</p>

<p>"Splendid! Splendid!" cried one of the white men,
a bearded giant whose flashing eyes and mass of
brown hair gave him the look of a lion. "We will
make it the white woman's peace. Bravo!" And he
turned to Mrs. Abel, whose face lit up with pleasure
at his happy excitement.</p>

<p>"No white man has even seen the people of Iala,"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
said Tamate&mdash;for that was the native name given to
James Chalmers, the Scottish boy who had now gone
out to far-off Papua as a missionary.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "Iko there"&mdash;and
he pointed to a stalwart Papuan who stood by the
funnel&mdash;"is the only one of us who has seen them and
can speak their tongue.</p>

<p>"It is dangerous for your wife to go among these
people," he went on, turning to Mr. Abel, "but she will
help us more than anything else possibly can to make
friends." And Mr. Abel nodded, for he knew that
when the Papuans mean to fight they send their women
and children away; and that when they saw Mrs. Abel
they would believe that the white people came as friends
and not enemies.</p>

<p>As the steamer carried this scouting party against the
swift current up the river toward Iala, Tamate wanted
to find how far up the river the village lay. So he
beckoned Iko to him. Tamate did not know a word of
the dialect which Iko spoke, but he had with him
an old wrinkled Papuan, who knew Iko's language, and
who looked out with worshipping eyes at the great
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>white man who was his friend. So Tamate, wishing to
ask Iko how far away the village of Iala was, spoke
first to old Vaaburi,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and then Vaaburi asked Iko.</p>

<p>Iko stretched out his dark forefinger, and made them
understand that that finger meant the length of their
journey to Iala. Then with his other hand he touched
his forefinger under the second joint to show how far
they had travelled on their journey&mdash;not a third of the
distance.</p>

<p>Hour after hour went by, as the steamer drove her
way through the swiftly running waters of Aivai. And
ever Iko pointed further and further up his finger until
at last they had reached his claw-like nail. By three
o'clock the middle of the nail was reached. The eyes of
all looked anxiously ahead. At every curve of the river
they strained their sight to see if Iala were in view.
How would these savage people welcome the white men
and woman in their snorting great canoe that had no
paddles, nor oars? There came a sharp bend in the
river, and then a long straight reach of water lying
between the forest-covered banks. Suddenly Iko called
out, and Tamate and Mr. and Mrs. Abel peered ahead.</p>

<p>The great trees of the river nearly met above their
heads, and only a narrow strip of sky could be seen.</p>

<p>There in the distance were the houses of Iala, close
clustered on both banks of the steaming river. They
stood on piles of wood driven into the mud, like houses
on stilts, and their high-pointed bamboo roofs stood out
over the river like gigantic poke-bonnets.</p>

<p>"Slow," shouted Tamate to the engineer. The <i>Miro</i><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
slackened speed till she just stemmed the running current
and no more.</p>

<p>"It will be a bit of a shock to them," said Tamate to
his friends, "to see this launch. We will give them time
to get their wits together again."</p>

<p>Looking ahead through their glasses, the white men
and Mrs. Abel could see canoes swiftly crossing and re-crossing
the river and men rushing about.</p>

<p>"Full speed ahead," cried Tamate again, and then
after a few revolutions of the engine, "Go slow. It
will never do," he said, "to drop amongst them while
they are in that state. They will settle down presently."
And then, as he looked up at the sky between the waving
branches of the giant trees, "we have got a good two
hours' daylight yet," he said.</p>

<p>Life and death to Tamate and his friends hung in the
balance, for they were three people unarmed, and here
were dark savage warriors in hundreds. Everything
depended on his choosing just the right moment for
going into the midst of these people. So he watched
them closely, knitting his shaggy eyebrows together as
he measured their state of mind by their actions. He
was the Scout of Christ in Papua, and he must be
watchful and note all those things that escape most men
but mean so much to trained eyes. Tamate seemed to
have a strange gift that made him able, even where
other men could tell nothing, to say exactly when it
was, and when it was not, possible to go among a wild,
untouched tribe.</p>

<p>Now the bewildered Ialan savages had grown
quieter. Tamate called to the engineer to drive ahead
once more. Slowly the launch forged her way through
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>the running waters and drew nearer and nearer to the
centre of Iala.</p>

<p>There on either side stood the houses in long rows
stretching up the river, and on the banks hundreds of
men stood silent and as still as trees. Their canoes lay
half in and half out of the water ready for instant
launching. In each canoe stood its crew erect and
waiting. All the women and children had been sent
away, for these men were out to fight. They did not
know whether this strange house upon the water with
the smoke coming from its chimney was the work of
gods or devils. Still they stood there to face the
strange thing and, if need be, to fight.</p>

<p>Brown Iko stood in the bows of the <i>Miro</i>; near him
stood Tamate. Then the engine stopped and the anchor
was dropped overboard. The savages stood
motionless. Not a weapon could be seen. The engineer,
hearing the anchor-chain rattle through the hole,
blew the steam-whistle in simple high spirits. As the
shriek of the whistle echoed under the arches of the
trees, with the swiftness of lightning the Ialan warriors
swung their long bows from behind their bodies.
Without stooping each caught up an arrow that stood
between his toes and with one movement fixed it and
pulled the bamboo strings of their black bows till the
notch of the arrows touched their ears. A hundred arrows
were aimed at the hearts of Tamate and Mr. and
Mrs. Abel.</p>

<p>Swiftly Iko stood upon the bulwark of the <i>Miro</i>, and
shouted just one word at the top of his voice. It was
the Ialan word for "Peace." And again he shouted it,
and yet again "Peace, Peace!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>Then he cried out "Pouta!"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It was the name of
the chief of these savages. They had but to let the
arrows from their bows and all would have been over.
There was silence. What order would Pouta give?</p>

<p>Then from the bank on their right came the sound
of an answering voice. In a flash every arrow was
taken from its bow, and again not a weapon was to
be seen.</p>

<p>Iko then called out again to Pouta, and Tamate told
Iko what he was to say to his friend, the savage chief.
For some minutes the conversation went on. At last
Iko came to the point of asking for a canoe to take them
ashore.</p>

<p>Chief Pouta hesitated. Then he gave his command,
and a large canoe was launched from the bank into the
river and slowly paddled towards the <i>Miro</i>.</p>

<p>As the canoe came towards them, Tamate turned to
Mrs. Abel, who had stood there without flinching with
all the arrows pointed toward the boat; and he spoke
words like these: "Your bravery is our strength.
Seeing you makes them believe that we come for peace.
You give them greater confidence in us than all our
words."</p>

<p>By this time the canoe had paddled alongside the
launch. Tamate went over the side first into the canoe,
then Mrs. Abel, then Mr. Abel, Iko, and Vaaburi. The
canoe pushed off again and paddled toward the landing
place, where a crowd of Ialan savages filled every inch
of space.</p>

<p>As soon as the bow of the canoe touched the bank,
Tamate, without hesitating a second, stepped out with<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
Iko. Together they walked up to the chief Pouta, and
Tamate put his arms around him in an embrace of
peace.</p>

<p>Pouta, standing on a high place, shouted to all his
warriors. But none of the white people knew a word of
his meaning.</p>

<p>Look where they would, in every direction, this white
woman and the two men were completely surrounded
by an unbroken mass of wild and armed savages, who
stood gazing upon the strange apparitions in their
midst.</p>

<p>Tamate, without a pause, perfectly calm, and showing
no signs of fear, spoke to Pouta and his men
through old Vaaburi and Iko.</p>

<p>"We have come," he said, "so that we may be
friends. We have come without weapons. We have
brought with us a woman of our tribe, for we come
in peace. We are strangers. But we come with great
things to tell. Some day we will come again and will
stay with you and will tell you all our message. To-day
we come only to make friends."</p>

<p>Then Iko closed his eyes and prayed in the language
of the people of Iala.</p>

<p>Turning to his friends when the prayer was over,
Tamate said quietly: "Now, we must get aboard as
quickly as we possibly can. My plan for a first visit is
to come, make friends and get away again swiftly.
When we are gone they will talk to one another about
us. Next time we come we shall meet friends."</p>

<p>So they walked down through an avenue of armed
Papuans to the bank, and got into the canoe again: the
paddles flashed as she drove swiftly through the water
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>toward the launch. As they climbed her side, the anchor
was weighed, the <i>Miro</i> swung round, her engines
started, and, carried down by the swift stream, she
slipped past the packed masses of silent men who lined
the banks.</p>

<p>It is a great thing to be a pathfinder through a country
which no man has penetrated before. But it is a
greater thing to do as these missionary-scouts did on
their journey up the Aivai and find a path of friendship
into savage lives. To do that was the greatest joy in
Tamate's life. For he said, when he had spent many
years in this work:</p>

<p>"Recall the twenty-one years, give me back all its
experiences, give me its shipwrecks, give me its standings
in the face of death, give it me surrounded with
savages with spears and clubs, give it me back again
with spears flying about me, with the club knocking me
to the ground, give it me back, and I will still be your
missionary."</p>

<h4>A SOUTH SEA SAMARITAN</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Ruatoka</i><br />
(Date of Incident, about 1878)</p>


<p>It was a dark night and silent. The swish and lapping
of the waters on the Port Moresby beach on the
southern shore of the immense island of New Guinea,
filled the air with a quiet hush of expectation.</p>

<p>In a little white house sat a tall, dark man with his
wife. The man was Ruatoka. If you had asked "Who
is Ruatoka?" of all the Papuans for miles around Port
Moresby, they would have wondered at your ignorance.
"Ruatoka," they would have told you, was a
"Jesus man." He walked among their villages, and
did not fear them when they threatened him with spears
and clubs. He gave them medicines when they were
ill, and nursed them. He spoke strong words to them
which made their hearts turn to water within them
when he showed that they did wrong. He often stopped
them from fighting.</p>

<p>Ruatoka, with his wife, had sailed from the South
Sea Islands with Tamate,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who was to them their
great hero.</p>

<p>"My fathers of old were heathen, savage men on the
island of Mangaia," he would say. "The white men
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>came to them and brought the story of Jesus. Now
we are happy. But we, too, must go to the men of
New Guinea, just as the white men came to us. To-day
the New Guinea Papuans are savage cannibals
and heathen. To-morrow they will know Jesus and be
as happy as we are."</p>

<p>So Ruatoka had been trained as a teacher and
preacher as well as a house-builder and carpenter; and
his wife was taught how to teach children as well as
good housekeeping.</p>

<p>This was the brown man, Ruatoka, who sat that night
in his little house at Port Moresby on the shore behind
the great reef of Papua. Suddenly there came a knock
at his door. The door opened, and the black, frightened
faces of Papuans, with staring eyes, looked at
him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>And they told him that, as they came at sunset along
the path from the people of Larogi to Port Moresby,
they found by the side of the path a white man. "He
was dying," they said. "We were afraid to touch him.
If we touched him and he died, his ghost would haunt
us for evermore."</p>

<p>Ruatoka stood up at once and reached for his lantern,
and turning to the men said:</p>

<p>"Come and guide me to the place."</p>

<p>They said, "No, we are afraid of the demon spirit.
It is night. The man will die. We are afraid of the
spirits. We will not go."</p>

<p>Ruatoka's father had told him when he was a boy
how his own people in the years before had dreaded the
spirit-demons of Mangaia, but that he must learn that
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>there were no spirits to be dreaded; that one great
Father-Spirit ruled above all, and would take care of
His children, and that all those children must love one
another.</p>

<p>So Rua, as they called him, knowing that the white
man who lay sick by the roadside in the night, though
of another colour, was yet a brother, and knowing that
no demon spirit could harm him in the dark, lighted
his lantern, poured water into a bottle, took a long
piece of cloth, folded it up, and started out under the
stars.</p>

<p>He walked for mile after mile up steep hills and
down into valleys along the path; but nothing did he
hear save the cry of a night bird. At last he had gone
five miles, and was wondering whether he could ever
find the sick man (for the long grass towered up on
either side and all was still), when he heard a low
moaning. Listening intently he found the direction
of the sound, and then moved towards it. He found
there, at the side of the path, a white man named
Neville, nearly dead. He was moaning with the pain
of the fever, yet unconscious.</p>

<p>Taking his bottle, Ruatoka poured a little water
down the throat of the man. He then took the long
piece of cloth, wound it round Neville, took the two ends
in his hands, and stooping, he pulled and strained with
all his great strength, until at last Neville lay like a
sack upon his shoulders. Staggering along, Ruatoka
climbed the hills that rose 300 feet high. Again and
again he was bound to rest, for the man on his shoulders
was as heavy as Ruatoka himself. He tottered
down the hill path, and at last, just as the first light of
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>dawn was breaking over the eastern hills, Ruatoka
staggered into his home, laid the sick man upon the only
bed he had, and then himself laid down upon the floor,
wearied almost to death. There he slept while his wife
nursed and tended the fever-stricken Neville back to
life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Over a thousand years before that day Wilfrid<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> had
brought life and joy to the starving Saxons of the
South coast of England. A hundred years before that
day white men, the great-great-grandchildren of those
Saxons, had started out in <i>The Duff</i> and, sailing across
the world, had taken life and joy in the place of the terror
of demons and the death by the club to the men of
the Islands of the Seas.</p>

<p>Now Ruatoka, the South Sea islander, having in his
heart the same brave spirit of the Good Shepherd&mdash;that
spirit of the Good Samaritan, of help and preparedness,
of courage and of chivalry, had carried life and joy
back to the North Sea islander, the Briton who had
fallen by the roadside in Papua.</p>

<p>Ruatoka was a brown Greatheart. It was with him
as it must be with all brave sons who serve that great
Captain, Jesus Christ: he wanted to be in the front of
the battle. When the great Tamate was killed and
eaten by the cannibals of Goaribari, Ruatoka wrote a
letter to a missionary who lived and still lives in Papua.
This is the end of the letter:</p>

<p>"Hear my wish. It is a great wish. The remainder
of my strength I would spend in the place where Tamate
was killed. In that village I would live. In that
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>place where they killed men, Jesus Christ's name and
His word I would teach to the people that they may become
Jesus' children. My wish is just this. You know
it. I have spoken.</p>

<h4>THE MAN WHO WOULD GO ON</h4>

<p class='center'><i>David Livingstone</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Dates born 1813, died 1873)</p>


<p>There was a deathly stillness in the hot African air
as two bronzed Scots strode along the narrow forest
path.</p>

<p>The one, a young, keen-eyed doctor,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> glanced quickly
through the trees and occasionally turned aside to pick
some strange orchid and to slip it into his collecting
case. The other strode steadily along with that curious,
"resolute forward tread" of his.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He was David Livingstone.
Behind them came a string of African bearers
carrying in bundles on their heads the tents and food
of the explorers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a crunch, Livingstone's heel went
through a white object half hidden in the long grass&mdash;a
thing like an ostrich's egg. He stooped&mdash;and his
strong, bronzed face was twisted with mingled sorrow
and anger, as, looking into the face of his younger
friend, he gritted out between his clenched teeth, "The
slave-raiders again!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>It was the whitening skull of an African boy.</p>

<p>For weeks those two Britons had driven their little
steamer (the <i>Asthmatic</i> they called her, because of her
wheezing engines) up the Zambesi river and were
now exploring its tributary the Shir&eacute;.</p>

<p>Each morning, before they could start the ship's
engines, they had been obliged to take poles and push
from between the paddles of the wheels the dead bodies
of Africans&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;slain bodies
which had floated down from the villages that the Arab
slave-raiders had burned and sacked. Livingstone was
out on the long, bloody trail of the slaver, the trail that
stretched on and on into the heart of Africa where no
white man had ever been.</p>

<p>This negro boy's skull, whitening on the path, was
only one more link in the long, sickening shackle-chain
of slavery that girdled down-trodden Africa.</p>

<p>The two men strode on. The forest path opened out
to a broad clearing. They were in an African village.
But no voice was heard and no step broke the horrible
silence. It was a village of death. The sun blazed on
the charred heaps which now marked the sites of happy
African homes; the gardens were desolate and utterly
destroyed. The village was wiped out. Those who
had submitted were far away, trudging through the forest,
under the lash of the slaver; those who had been
too old to walk or too brave to be taken without fight
were slain.</p>

<p>The heart of Livingstone burned with one great
resolve&mdash;he would track this foul thing into the very
heart of Africa and then blazon its horrors to the whole
world.</p>

<p><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>The two men trudged back to the river bank again.
Now, with their brown companions, they took the
shallow boat that they had brought on the deck of the
<i>Asthmatic</i>, and headed still farther up the Shir&eacute; river
from the Zambesi toward the unknown Highlands of
Central Africa.</p>


<p><i>Facing Spears and Arrows</i></p>

<p>Only the sing-song chant of the Africans as they
swung their paddles, and the frightened shriek of a
glittering parrot, broke the stillness as the boat pushed
northward against the river current.</p>

<p>The paddles flashed again, and as the boat came
round a curve in the river they were faced by a sight
that made every man sit, paddle in hand, motionless
with horror. The bank facing them in the next curve
of the river was black with men. The ranks of savages
bristled with spears and arrows. A chief yelled to them
to turn back. Then a cloud of arrows flew over the
boat.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Livingstone quietly to the Africans.
Their paddles took the water and the boat leapt toward
the savage semi-circle on the bank. The water was
shallower now. Before any one realised what was
happening Livingstone had swung over the edge of the
boat and, up to his waist in water, was wading ashore
with his arms above his head.</p>

<p>"It is peace!" he called out, and waded on toward
the barbs of a hundred arrows and spears. The men
in the boat sat breathless, waiting to see their leader
fall with a score of spears through his body. But the
savages on the bank were transfixed with amazement at<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
Livingstone's sheer audacity. Awed by something god-like
in this unflinching and unarmed courage, no finger
let fly a single arrow.</p>

<p>"You think," he called to the chief, "that I am a
slave-raider." For Livingstone knew that he had never
in all his wanderings been attacked by Africans save
where they had first been infuriated by the cruel raiders.</p>

<p>The chief scowled.</p>

<p>"See," cried Livingstone, baring his arm to show his
white skin as he again and again had done when threatened
by Africans, "is this the colour of the men who
come to make slaves and to kill?"</p>

<p>The savages gazed with astonishment. They had
never before seen so white a skin.</p>

<p>"No," Livingstone went on, "this is the skin of the
tribe that has heart toward the African."</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously the man had dropped the spear
points and arrow heads as he was speaking. The chief
listened while Livingstone, who was now on the bank,
told the savages how he had come across the great
waters from a far-off land with a message of peace and
goodwill.</p>

<p>Unarmed and with a dauntless heroism the "white
man who would go on" had won a great victory over
that tribe. He now passed on in his boat up the river
and over rapids toward the wonderful shining Highlands
in the heart of Africa.</p>


<p><i>"Deliverance to the Captives"</i></p>

<p>Dr. Kirk was recalled to England by the British
Government; but Livingstone trudged on in increasing
loneliness over mountains and across rivers and lakes,
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>plunging through marshes, racked a score of times with
fever, robbed of his medicines, threatened again and
again by the guns of the slave-raiding Arabs and the
spears and clubs of savage head-hunters, bearing on
his bent shoulders the Cross of the negroes' agony&mdash;slavery,
till at last, alone and on his knees in the dead of
night, our Greatheart crossed his last River, into the
presence of his Father in heaven.</p>

<p>Yet still, though his body was dead, his spirit would
go on. For the life Livingstone lived, the death he
died, and the record he wrote of the slave-raiders' horrible
cruelties thrilled all Britain to heal that "open sore
of the world." Queen Victoria made Dr. Kirk her
consul at Zanzibar, and told him to make the Sultan of
Zanzibar order all slave-trading through that great
market to cease. And to-day, because of David Livingstone,
through all the thousands of miles of Africa
over which he trod, no man dare lay the shackles of
slavery on another. To-day, where Livingstone saw
the slave-market in Zanzibar, a grand church stands,
built by negro hands, and in that cathedral you may
hear the negro clergy reading such words as&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE BLACK PRINCE OF AFRICA</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Khama</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Dates 1850&mdash;the present day)</p>


<p>One day men came running into a village in South
Africa to say that a strange man, whose body was
covered with clothes and whose face was not black,
was walking toward their homes. He was coming
from the South.</p>

<p>Never before had such a man been seen in their tribe.
So there was great excitement and a mighty chattering
went through the round wattle of mud huts with their
circular thatched roofs.</p>

<p>The African Chief, Sekhome&mdash;who was the head of
this Bamangwato tribe and who was also a noted witch-doctor&mdash;started
out along the southward trail to meet
the white man. By his side ran his eldest son. He was
a lithe, blithe boy; his chocolate coloured skin shone and
the muscles rippled as he trotted along. He was so
swift that his name was the name of the antelope that
gallops across the veldt. Cama is what the Bamangwato
call the antelope. Khama is how we spell the boy's
name.</p>

<p>He gazed in wonder as he saw a sturdy man wearing
clothes such as he had not seen before&mdash;what we call
coat and hat, trousers and boots. He looked into the
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>bronzed face of the white man and saw that his eyes
and mouth were kind. Together they walked back into
the village. Chief Sekhome found that the white man's
name was David Livingstone; and that he was a kind
doctor who could make boys and men better when they
were ill, with medicines out of a black japanned box.</p>

<p>When evening came the boy Khama saw the strange
white man open another box and take out a curious
thing which seemed to open yet was full of hundreds
and hundreds of leaves. Khama had never seen such
a thing in his life and he could not understand why Livingstone
opened it and kept looking at it for a long
time, for he had never seen a book before and did not
even know what letters were or what reading was.</p>

<p>It seemed wonderful to him when he heard that that
book could speak to Livingstone without making any
sound and that it told him about the One Infinite, Holy,
Loving God, Who is Father of all men, black or brown
or white, and Whose Son, Jesus Christ, came to teach
us all to love God and to love one another. For the
book was the Bible which Livingstone all through his
heroic exploring of Africa read each day.</p>

<p>So Livingstone passed on from the village; but this
boy Khama never forgot him, and in time&mdash;as we shall
see&mdash;other white men came and taught Khama himself
to read that same book and worship that same God.</p>


<p><i>The Fight with the Lion</i></p>

<p>Meanwhile strange adventures came to the growing
young Khama. This is the story of some of them:</p>

<p>The leaping flames of a hunting camp-fire threw upon
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>the dark background of thorn trees weird shadows of
the men who squatted in a circle on the ground, talking.</p>

<p>The men were all Africans, the picked hunters from
the tribe of the Bamangwato. They were out on the
spoor of a great lion that had made himself the terror
of the tribe. Night after night the lion had leapt
among their oxen and had slain the choicest in the
chief's herds. Again and again the hunters had gone
out on the trail of the ferocious beast; but always they
returned empty-handed, though boasting loudly of what
they would do when they should face the lion.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, yes, to-morrow," cried a young Bamangwato
hunter rolling his eyes, "I will slay <i>tau e
bogale</i>&mdash;the fierce lion."</p>

<p>The voices of the men rose on the night air as the
whole group declared that the beast should ravage their
herds no more&mdash;the whole group, except one. This
young man's tense face and the keen eyes that glowed
in the firelight showed his contempt for those who
swaggered so much and did so little. He was Khama,
the son of Sekhome, the chief. The wild flames
gleamed on him as he stood there, full six feet of tireless
manhood leaning on his gun, like a superb statue
carved in ebony. Those swift, spare limbs of his, that
could keep pace with a galloping horse, gave him the
right to his name, Khama&mdash;the Antelope.</p>

<p>The voices dropped, and the men, rolling themselves
in the skins of wild beasts, lay down and slept&mdash;all
except one, whose eyes watched in the darkness as sleeplessly
as the stars. When they were asleep Khama
took up his gun and went out into the starry night.</p>

<p>The night passed. As the first flush of dawn paled
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>the stars, and the men around the cold ashes of the fire
sat up, they gazed in awed amazement. For they saw,
striding toward them, their tall young chieftain; and
over his shoulders hung the tawny skin and mane of a
full-grown king lion. Alone in the night he had slain
the terror of the tribe!</p>

<p>The men who had boasted of what they meant to do
and had never performed, never heard Khama&mdash;either
at that time or later&mdash;make any mention of this great
feat.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that the great Bamangwato tribe
looked at the tall, silent, resolute young chieftain and,
comparing him with his crafty father Sekhome and his
treacherous, cowardly younger brother Khamane, said,
"Khama is our <i>boikanyo</i>&mdash;our confidence."</p>


<p><i>The Fight with the Witch-doctors</i></p>

<p>The years went by; and that fierce old villain Sekhome
plotted and laid ambush against the life of his
valiant son, Khama. Men who followed David Livingstone
into Africa had come as missionaries to his tribe
and had taught him the story of Jesus and given him
the knowledge of reading and writing. So Khama had
become a Christian, though Sekhome his father was
still a heathen witch-doctor. Khama would have nothing
to do with the horrible ceremonies by which the
boys of the tribe were initiated into manhood; nor
would he look on the heathen rain-making incantations,
though his father smoked with anger against him.
Under a thousand insults and threats of death Khama
stood silent, never insulting nor answering again, and
always treating with respect his unnatural father.</p>

<p><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>"You, as the son of a great chief, must marry other
wives," said old Sekhome, whose wives could not be
numbered. Young Khama firmly refused, for the
Word of God which ruled his life told him that he must
have but one wife. Sekhome foamed with futile rage.</p>

<p>"You must call in the rain-doctors to make rain,"
said Sekhome, as the parched earth cracked under the
flaming sun. Khama knew that their wild incantations
had no power to make rain, but that God alone ruled
the heavens. So he refused.</p>

<p>Sekhome now made his last and most fearful attack.
He was a witch-doctor and master of the witch-doctors
whose ghoulish incantations made the Bamangwato
tremble in terror of unseen devils.</p>

<p>One night the persecuted Khama woke at the sound
of strange clashing and chanting. Looking out he saw
the fitful flame of a fire. Going out from his hut, he
saw the <i>lolwapa</i> or court in front of it lit up with weird
flames round which the black wizards danced with
horns and lions' teeth clashing about their necks, and
with manes of beasts' hair waving above their horrible
faces. As they danced they cast charms into the fire
and chanted loathsome spells and terrible curses on
Khama. As a boy he had been taught that these witch-doctors
had the power to slay or to smite with foul
diseases. He would have been more than human if he
had not felt a shiver of nameless dread at this lurid and
horrible dance of death.</p>

<p>Yet he never hesitated. He strode forward swiftly,
anger and contempt on his face, scattering the witch-doctors
from his path and leaping full upon their fire of
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>charms, stamped it out and scattered its embers broadcast.
The wizards fled into the darkness of the night.</p>


<p><i>The Fight with the Kaffir Beer</i></p>

<p>At last Khama's treacherous old father, Sekhome,
died. Khama was acclaimed the supreme chief of all
the Bamangwato.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He galloped out at the head of his
horsemen to pursue Lobengula, the ferocious chief of
the Matabele who had struck fear into the Bamangwato
for many years. Even Lobengula, who to his
dying day carried in his neck a bullet from Khama's
gun, said of him, "The Bamangwato are dogs, but
Khama is a man."</p>

<p>Khama had now freed his people from the terror of
the lion, the tyranny of witch-doctors, and the dread of
the Matabele. Yet the deadliest enemy of Khama and
the most loathsome tyrant of the Bamangwato was still
in power,&mdash;the strong drink which degrades the African
to unspeakable depths.</p>

<p>Even as Khama charged at the head of his men into
the breaking ranks of the Matabele, his younger
brother, Khamane, whom he had put in charge of his
city in his absence, said to the people: "You may brew
beer again now." Many of the people did not obey, but
others took the corn of the tribe and brewed beer from
it.</p>

<p>At night the cries of beaten women rose, and the
weird chants of incantations and of foul unclean dances
were heard. Khamane called the older men together
around his fire. Pots of beer passed from hand to
hand. As the men grew fuddled they became bolder
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>and more boastful. Khamane then spoke to them and
said, "Why should Khama rule you? Remember he
forbids you to make and to drink beer. He has done
away with the dances of the young men. He will not
let you make charms or throw enchanted dice or make
incantations for rain. He is a Christian. If I ruled
you, you should do all these things."</p>

<p>When Khama rode back again into his town he saw
men and women lying drunk under the eaves of their
huts and others reeling along the road. At night the
sounds of chants and drinking dances rose on the air.</p>

<p>His anger was terrible. For once he lost his temper.
He seized a burning torch and running to the hut of
Khamane set fire to the roof and burned the house
down over his drunken brother's head. He ordered all
the beer that had been brewed to be seized, and poured
it out upon the veldt. He knew that he was fighting a
fiercer enemy than the Matabele, a foe that would throttle
his tribe and destroy all his people if he did not
conquer it. The old men of the tribe muttered against
him and plotted his death. He met them face to face.
His eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"When I was still a lad," he said, "I used to think
how I would govern my town and what kind of a kingdom
it should be. One thing I determined, I would
not rule over a drunken town or people. <span class="smcap">I will not
have drink in this town</span>. If you must have it you
must go."</p>


<p><i>The Fight with the White Man's "Fire-water"</i></p>

<p>Khama had conquered for the moment. But white
men, Englishmen, came to the town. They set up
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>stores. And in the stores they began to sell brandy
from large casks.</p>

<p>The drinking of spirits has more terrible effects on
the African than even on white men. Once he starts
drinking, the African cannot stop and is turned into a
sot. The ships of the white man have been responsible
to a terrible extent for sending out the "fire-water" to
Africa.</p>

<p>Khama called the white traders in the tribe together.</p>

<p>"It is my desire," he said, "that no strong drink
shall be sold in my town."</p>

<p>"We will not bring the great casks of brandy," they
replied, "but we hope you will allow us to have cases of
bottles as they are for medicine."</p>

<p>"I consent," said Khama, "but there must be no
drunkenness."</p>

<p>"Certainly," the white men replied, "there shall be
no drunkenness."</p>

<p>In a few days one of the white traders had locked
himself into his house in drunken delirium, naked and
raving. Morning after morning Khama rose before
daybreak to try and get to the man when he was sober,
but all the time he was drunk. Then one morning this
man gathered other white men together in a house and
they sat drinking and then started fighting one another.</p>

<p>A boy ran to Khama to tell him. The chief went to
the house and strode in. The room was a wreck. The
men lay senseless with their white shirts stained with
blood.</p>

<p>Khama with set, stern face turned and walked to the
house where he often went for counsel, the home of
his friend, Mr. Hepburn, the missionary. Mr. Hep<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>burn
lay ill with fever. Khama told him what the white
men had done. Hepburn burned with shame and anger
that his own fellow-countrymen should so disgrace
themselves. Ill as he was he rose and went out with
the chief and saw with his own eyes that it was as
Khama said.</p>

<p>"I will clear them all out of my town," cried the chief.</p>

<p>It was Saturday night.</p>


<p><i>Khama's Decisive Hour</i></p>

<p>On the Monday morning Khama sent word to all the
white men to come to him. It was a cold, dreary day.
The chief sat waiting in the <i>Kgotla</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> while the white
men came together before him. Hepburn, the missionary,
sat by his side. Those who knew Khama saw as
soon as they looked into his grim face that no will on
earth could turn him from his decisions that day.</p>

<p>"You white men,"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> he said to them sternly, "have
insulted and despised me in my own town because I am
a black man. If you despise us black men, what do you
want here in the country that God has given to us?
Go back to your own country."</p>

<p>His voice became hard with a tragic sternness.</p>

<p>"I am trying," he went on, "to lead my people to act
according to the word of God which we have received
from you white people, and yet <i>you</i> show them an example
of wickedness such as we never knew. You,"
and his voice rose in burning scorn, "you, the people
of the word of God! You know that some of my own
brothers"&mdash;he was referring to Khamane especially&mdash;<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>"have
learned to like the drink, and you know that I
do not want them to see it even, that they may forget
the habit. Yet you not only bring it in and offer it to
them, but you try to tempt <i>me</i> with it.</p>

<p>"I make an end of it to-day. Go! Take your cattle
and leave my town and <i>never come back again</i>!"</p>

<p>No man moved or spoke. They were utterly shamed
and bewildered. Then one white man, who had lived
in the town since he was a lad, pleaded with Khama for
pity as an old friend.</p>

<p>"You," said the chief with biting irony, "my friend?
You&mdash;the ringleader of those who despise my laws.
You are my worst enemy. You pray for pity? No!
for you I have no pity. It is my duty to have pity on
my people over whom God placed me, and I am going
to show them pity to-day; and that is my duty to them
and to God.... Go!"</p>

<p>And they all went.</p>

<p>Then the chief ordered in his young warriors and
huntsmen.</p>

<p>"No one of you," he said, "is to drink beer." Then
he called a great meeting of the whole town. In serried
masses thousand upon thousand the Bamangwato faced
their great chief. He lifted up his voice:</p>

<p>"I, Khama, your chief, order that you shall not make
beer. You take the corn that God has given to us in
answer to our prayers and you destroy it. Nay, you
not only destroy it, but you make stuff with it that
causes mischief among you."</p>

<p>There was some murmuring.</p>

<p>His eyes flashed like steel.</p>

<p><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>"You can kill me," he said, "but you cannot conquer
me."</p>

<p><i>The Black Prince of Eighty</i></p>

<p>If you rode as a guest toward Khama's town over
seventy years after those far-off days when Livingstone
first went there, as you came in sight of the great
stone church that the chief has built, you would see
tearing across the African plain a whirlwind of dust.
It would race toward you, with the soft thunder of
hoofs in the loose soil. When the horses were almost
upon you&mdash;with a hand of steel&mdash;chief Khama would
rein in his charger and his bodyguard would pull up
behind him.</p>

<p>Over eighty years old, grey and wrinkled, he would
spring from his horse, without help, to greet you&mdash;still
Khama, the Antelope. Old as he is, he is as alert
as ever. He heard that a great all Africa aeroplane
route was planned after the Great War. At once he
offered to make a great aerodrome, and the day at last
came when Khama&mdash;eighty-five years old&mdash;who had
seen Livingstone, the first white man to visit his tribe&mdash;stood
watching the first aeroplane come bringing a
young officer from the clouds.</p>

<p>He stands there, the splendid chief of the Bamangwato&mdash;"steel-true,
blade-straight." He is the Black
Prince of Africa&mdash;who has indeed won his spurs
against the enemies of his people.</p>

<p>And if you were to ask him the secret of the power
by which he has done these things, Khama the silent,
who is not used to boasting, would no doubt lead you
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>at dawn to the <i>Kgotla</i> before his huts. There at every
sunrise he gathers his people together for their morning
prayers at the feet of the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Captain and King of our Great Crusade for
the saving of Africa.</p>

<h4>THE KNIGHT OF THE SLAVE GIRLS</h4>

<p class='center'><i>George Grenfell</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Dates, b. 1849, d. 1906)</p>


<p><i>The Building of the Steamship</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When David Livingstone lay dying in his hastily-built hut,
in the heart of Africa, with his black companions Susi and
Chumah attending him, almost his last words were, "How
far away is the Luapula?"</p>

<p>He knew that the river to which the Africans gave that
name was only a short distance away and that it flowed
northward. He thought that it might be the upper reaches
of the Nile, which had been sought by men through thousands
of years, but which none had ever explored.</p>

<p>Livingstone died in that hut (1873) and never knew what
Stanley, following in his footsteps, discovered later (1876-7),
viz., that the Luapula was really the upper stretch of the
Congo, the second largest river in the world (3000 miles
long), flowing into the Atlantic. The basin of the Congo
would cover the whole of Europe from the Black Sea to the
English Channel.</p>

<p>In the year when Livingstone died, and before Stanley
started to explore the Congo, a young man, who had been
thrilled by reading the travels of Livingstone, sailed to the
West Coast of Africa to the Kameruns.</p>

<p>His name was George Grenfell, a Cornish boy (born at
Sancreed, four miles from Penzance, in England), who
was brought up in Birmingham. He was apprenticed at
fifteen to a firm of hardware and machinery dealers. Here
he picked up, as a lad, some knowledge of machinery that
helped him later on the Congo. He had been thrilled
to meet at Bristol College, where he was trained for
his missionary work, a thin, worn, heroic man of tried
steel, Alfred Saker, the great Kamerun missionary, and Gren<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>fell
leapt for joy to go out to the dangerous West Coast
of Africa, where he worked hard, teaching the Africans to
make tables and bricks and to print and read, healing them
and preaching to them.</p>

<p>When Stanley came down the Congo to the sea and electrified
the world by the story of the great river, Grenfell
and the Baptist Missionary Society which he served conceived
the daring and splendid plan of starting a chain of mission
stations right from the mouth of the Congo eastward across
Africa. In 1878 Grenfell was on his way up the river&mdash;travelling
along narrow paths flanked by grass often fifteen
feet high, and crossing swamps and rivers, till after thirteen
attempts and in eighteen months he reached Stanley Pool,
February 1881. A thousand miles of river lay between Stanley
Pool and Stanley Falls, and even above Stanley Falls lay
thirteen hundred miles of navigable river. Canoes were
perilous. Hippopotami upset them, and men were dragged
down and eaten by crocodiles. They must have a steamer
right up there beyond the Falls in the very heart of Africa.</p>

<p>Grenfell went home to England, and the steamer <i>Peace</i>
was built on the Thames, Grenfell watching everything being
made from the crank to the funnel. She was built, launched,
and tried on the Thames; then taken to pieces and packed
in 800 packages, weighing 65 lbs. each, and taken to the
mouth of the Congo. On the heads and shoulders of a
thousand men the whole ship and the food of the party were
carried past the rapids, over a thousand miles along narrow
paths, in peril of snakes and leopards and enemy savages,
over streams crossed by bridges of vine-creepers, through
swamps, across ravines.</p>

<p>Grenfell's engineer, who was to have put the ship together,
died. At last they reached Stanley Pool. Grenfell with
eight negroes started to try to build the ship. It was a tremendous
task. Grenfell said the <i>Peace</i> was "prayed together."
It was prayer and hard work and gumption. At
last the ship was launched, steam was up, the <i>Peace</i> began
to move. "She lives, master, she lives!" shouted the excited
Africans.</p>

<p>A thousand thrilling adventures came to him as he steamed
up and down the river, teaching and preaching, often in the
face of poisoned arrows and spears. We are now going to
hear the story of one adventure.</p></div>

<p><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><i>The Steamer's Journey</i></p>

<p>The crocodiles drowsily dosing in the slime of the
Congo river bank stirred uneasily as a strange sound
broke the silence of the blazing African morning.
They lifted their heavy jaws and swung their heads
down stream. Their beady eyes caught sight of a
Thing mightier than a thousand crocodiles. It was
pushing its way slowly up stream.</p>

<p>The sound was the throb of the screw of the steamer
from whose funnel a light ribbon of smoke floated
across the river. An awning shaded the whole deck
from bow to stern. On the top of the awning, under a
little square canopy, stood a tall young negro; the
muscles in his sturdy arms and his broad shoulders
rippled under his dark skin as the wheel swung round
in his swift, strong hands.</p>

<p>The steamer drove up stream while the crocodiles,
startled by the wash of the boat, slid sullenly down the
bank and dived.</p>

<p>A short, bearded man, dressed in white duck, stood
on deck at the bows, where the steamer's name, <i>Peace</i>,
was painted. He was George Grenfell. His keen eyes
gleamed through the spectacles that rested on his
strong, arched nose. By his side stood his wife, looking
out up the river. They were searching for the landing-place
and the hut-roofs of some friendly river-side
town.</p>

<p>At last as the bows swung round the next bend in
the river they saw a village. The Africans rushed to
the bank and hurriedly pushed out their tree-trunk
canoes. Grenfell shouted an order. A bell rang. The
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>screw stopped and the steamer lay-to while he climbed
down into the ship's canoe and was paddled ashore.
The wondering people pushed and jostled around them
to see this strange man with his white face.</p>


<p><i>The Slave Girls</i></p>

<p>As they walked up among the huts, speaking with
the men of the town, Grenfell came to an open space.
As his quick eyes looked about he saw two little girls
standing bound with cords. They were tethered like
goats to a stake. Their little faces and round eyes
looked all forlorn. Even the wonder of the strange
bearded white man hardly kept back the tears that filled
their eyes.</p>

<p>"What are these?" he asked, turning to the chief.</p>

<p>The African pointed up the river. Grenfell's heart
burned in him, as the chief told how he and his men had
swept up the river in their canoes armed with their
spears and bows and arrows and had raided another
tribe.</p>

<p>"And these," said the chief, pointing to the girls,
who began to wonder what was going to happen, "these
are two girls that we captured. They are some of our
booty. They are slaves. They are tied there till someone
will come and buy them."</p>

<p>Grenfell could not resist the silent call of their woeful
faces. Quickly he gave beads and cloth to the chief,
and took the little girls back with him down to the
river bank. As they jumped into the canoe to go
aboard the S.S. <i>Peace</i>, the two girls wondered what
this strange new master would do with them. Would
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>he be cruel? Yet his eyes looked kind through those
funny, round, shining things balanced on his nose.</p>

<p>The girls at once forgot all their sorrows when they
jumped on board this wonderful river monster. They
felt it shiver and throb and begin to move. The bank
went farther and farther away. The <i>Peace</i> had again
started up stream.</p>

<p>The girls stood in wonder and gazed with open eyes
as the banks slid past. They saw the birds all green
and red flashing along the surface of the water, and
the huge hippopotami sullenly plunging into the river
like the floating islands of earth that sail down the
Congo. Their quick eyes noted the quaint iguana, like
giant lizards, sunning themselves on the branches of
the trees over the stream and then dropping like stones
into the stream as the steamer passed.</p>


<p><i>The Slave Girl's Brother</i></p>

<p>Then, suddenly, as they came round a bend in the
river, all was changed. There ahead Grenfell saw a
river town. The canoes were being manned rapidly by
warriors. The bank bristled with spears in the hands
of ferocious savages, whose faces were made horrible
by gashes and loathsome tattooing. In each canoe men
stood with bows in their hands and arrows drawn to
the head. The throb of the engines ceased. The ship
slowed up. But the canoes came on.</p>

<p>The men of this Congo town only knew one thing.
Enemies had, only a few weeks earlier, come from
down-river, had raided their town, burned their huts,
killed many of their braves, and carried away their
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>children. Here were men who had also come from
down the river. They must, therefore, be enemies.</p>

<p>Their chief shouted an order. In an instant a score
of spears hurtled at the ship and rattled on the steel
screens around the deck. The yell of the battle-cry of
the tribe echoed and re-echoed down the river.</p>

<p>Grenfell was standing by the little girls. Suddenly
one of them with dancing eyes shouted and waved her
arms.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Grenfell to her.</p>

<p>"See&mdash;see!" she cried, pointing to a warrior in a
canoe who was just poising a spear, "that is my
brother! That is my brother! This is my town!"</p>

<p>"Call to him," said Grenfell.</p>

<p>Her thin childish voice rang out. But no one heard
it among the warriors. Again she cried out to her
brother. The only answer was a hail of spears and
arrows.</p>

<p>Grenfell turned rapidly and shouted an order to the
engineer. Instantly a shriek, more wild and piercing
than the combined yells of the whole tribe, rent the air.
Again the shriek went up. The warriors stood transfixed
with spear and arrow in hand like statues in
ebony. There was a moment's intense and awful
silence. They had never before heard the whistle of a
steamer!</p>

<p>"Shout again&mdash;quickly," whispered Grenfell to the
little African girl.</p>

<p>In a second the child's shrill voice rang out in the
silence across the water, crying first her brother's name,
and then her own.</p>

<p>The astonished warrior dropped his spear, caught up
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>his paddle and&mdash;in a few swift strokes&mdash;drove his
canoe towards the steamer. His astonishment at seeing
his sister aboard overcame all his dread of this
shrieking, floating island that moved without sails or
paddles.</p>

<p>Quickly she told her story of how the strange white
man in the great canoe that smoked had found her in
the village of their enemies, had saved her from slavery,
and&mdash;now, had brought her safely home again. The
story passed from lip to lip. Every spear and bow and
arrow was dropped.</p>

<p>The girls were quickly put ashore, and as Grenfell
walked up the village street every warrior who had but
a few moments before been seeking his blood was now
gazing at this strange friend who had brought back
to the tribe the daughters whom they thought they had
lost for ever.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Grenfell went on with his work in face of fever, inter-tribal
fighting, slave-raiders, the horrors of wife and slave-slaughter
at funerals, witch-killing&mdash;and in some ways worse still, the
horrible cruelties of the Belgian rubber-traders&mdash;for over a
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>In June 1906, accompanied by his negro companions, he
lay at Yalemba, sick with fever. Two of the Africans wrote
a letter for help to other missionaries:</p>

<p>"We are very sorrow," they wrote, "because out Master
is very sick. So now we beging you one of you let him
come to help Mr Grenfell please. We think now is near to
die, but we don't know how to do with him. Yours,</p>

<p class='author'>
DISASI MAKULO,<br />
MASCOO LUVUSU."<br />
</p>

<p>To-day all up the fifteen hundred miles of Congo waterway
the power of the work done by Grenfell and the men who
came with him and after him has changed all the life. Gone
are the slave-raiders, the inter-tribal wars, the cruelties of
the white men, along that line. There stand instead negroes
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>who cap make bricks, build houses, turn a lathe; engineers,
printers, bookbinders, blacksmiths, carpenters, worshipping
in churches built with their own hands. But beyond, and
among the myriad tributaries and the vast forests millions of
men have never yet even heard of the love of God in Jesus
Christ, and still work their hideous cruelties.</p>

<p>So Grenfell, like Livingstone, opened a door. It stands
open.</p></div>

<h4>"A MAN WHO CAN TURN HIS HAND TO ANYTHING"</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Alexander Mackay</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Dates 1863-1876)</p>


<p>The inquisitive village folk stared over their garden
gates at Mr. Mackay, the minister of the Free Kirk of
Rhynie, a small Aberdeenshire village, as he stood with
his thirteen-year-old boy gazing into the road at their
feet. The father was apparently scratching at the
stones and dust with his stick. The villagers shook
their heads.</p>

<p>"Fat's the minister glowerin' at, wi' his loon Alic,
among the stoor o' the turnpike?"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> asked the villagers
of one another.</p>

<p>The minister certainly was powerful in the pulpit,
but his ways were more than they could understand.
He was for ever hammering at the rocks on the moor
and lugging ugly lumps of useless stone homeward,
containing "fossils" as he called them.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Mackay was standing looking as though he
were trying to find something that he had lost in the
road. If they had been near enough to Alec and his
father they would have heard words like these:</p>

<p>"You see, Alec, this is the Zambesi River running
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>down from the heart of Africa into the Indian Ocean,
and here running into the Zambesi from the north is a
tributary, the Shir&eacute;. Livingstone going up that river
found wild savages who ..."</p>

<p>So the father was tracing in the dust of the road with
the point of his stick the course of the Zambesi which
Livingstone had just explored for the first time.</p>

<p>On these walks with his father Alec, with his blue
eyes wide open, used to listen to stories like the Yarn
we have read of the marvellous adventures of Livingstone.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Sometimes Mr. Mackay would stop and draw
triangles and circles with his stick. Then Alec would
be learning a problem in Euclid on this strange "blackboard"
of the road. He learned the Euclid&mdash;but he
preferred the Zambesi and Livingstone!</p>

<p>One day Alec was off by himself trudging down the
road with a fixed purpose in his mind, a purpose that
seemed to have nothing in the world to do with either
Africa or Euclid. He marched away from his little
village of Rhynie, where the burn runs around the
foot of the great granite mountain across the strath.
He trudged on for four miles. Then he heard a shrill
whistle. Would he be late after all? He ran swiftly
toward the little railway station. A ribbon of smoke
showed over the cutting, away to the right. Alec entered
the station and ran to one end of the platform as
the train slowed down and the engine stopped just opposite
where he stood.</p>

<p>He gazed at the driver and his mate on the footplate.
He followed every movement as the driver came round
the engine with his long-nosed oil-can, and opened and
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>shut small brass lids and felt the bearings with his
hand to see whether they were hot. The guard waved
his green flag. The whistle of the engine shrieked, and
the train steamed out of the station along the burnside
toward Huntly. Alec gazed down the line till the train
was out of sight and then, turning, left the station and
trudged homeward. When he reached Rhynie he had
walked eight miles to look at a railway engine for two
and a half minutes&mdash;and he was happy!</p>

<p>As he went along the village street he heard a familiar
sound.</p>

<p>"Clang&mdash;a&mdash;clang clang!&mdash;ssssssss!" It was irresistible.
He stopped, and stepped into the magic cavern
of darkness, gleaming with the forge-fire, where George
Lobban, the smith, having hammered a glowing horseshoe
into shape, gripped it with his pincers and flung it
hissing into the water.</p>

<p>Having cracked a joke with the laughing smith, Alec
dragged himself away from the smithy, past the green,
and looked in at the stable to curry-comb the pony and
enjoy feeling the little beast's muzzle nosing in his hand
for oats.</p>

<p>He let himself into the manse and ran up to his
work-room, where he began to print off some pages that
he had set up on his little printing press.</p>

<p>At supper his mother looked sadly at her boy with
his dancing eyes as he told her about the wonders of
the railway engine. In her heart she wanted him to be
a minister. And she did not see any sign that this boy
would ever become one: this lad of hers who was
always running off from his books to peer into the furnaces
of the gas works, or to tease the village carpenter
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>into letting him plane a board, or to sit, with chin in
hands and elbows on knees, watching the saddler cutting
and padding and stitching his leather, or to creep
into the carding-mill&mdash;like the Budge and Toddy whose
lives he had read&mdash;"to see weels go wound."</p>

<p>It was a bitter cold night in the Christmas vacation
fourteen years later.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Alec Mackay, now a young
engineering student, was lost to all sense of time as he
read of the hairbreadth escapes and adventures told by
the African explorer, Stanley, in his book, <i>How I found
Livingstone</i>.</p>

<p>He read these words of Stanley's:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For four months and four days I lived with Livingstone
in the same house, or in the same boat, or in the same tent,
and I never found a fault in him.... Each day's life with
him added to my admiration for him. His gentleness never
forsakes him: his hopefulness never deserts him. His is the
Spartan heroism, the inflexibility of the Roman, the enduring
resolution of the Anglo-Saxon. The man has conquered me."</p></div>

<p>Alexander Mackay put down Stanley's book and
gazed into the fire. Since the days when he had
trudged as a boy down to the station to see the railway
engine he had been a schoolboy in the Grammar School
at Aberdeen, and a student in Edinburgh, and while
there had worked in the great shipbuilding yards at
Leith amid the clang and roar of the rivetters and the
engine shop. He was now studying in Berlin, drawing
the designs of great engines far more wonderful than
the railway engine he had almost worshipped as a boy.</p>

<p>On the desk at Mackay's side lay his diary in which
he wrote his thoughts. In that diary were the words
that he himself had written:</p>
<p><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"This day last year<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Livingstone died&mdash;a Scotsman and a
Christian&mdash;loving God and his neighbour, in the heart of
Africa. 'Go thou and do likewise.'"</p></div>

<p>Mackay wondered. Could it ever be that he would
go into the heart of Africa like Livingstone? it
seemed impossible. What was the good of an engineer
among the lakes and forests of Central Africa?</p>

<p>On the table by the side of Stanley's <i>How I found
Livingstone</i> lay a newspaper, the Edinburgh <i>Daily Review</i>.
Mackay glanced at it; then he snatched it up and
read eagerly a letter which appeared there. It was a
new call to Central Africa&mdash;the call, through Stanley,
from King M'tesa of Uganda, that home of massacre
and torture. These are some of the words that Stanley
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"King M'tesa of Uganda has been asking me about the
white man's God.... Oh that some practical missionary
would come here. M'tesa would give him anything that he
desired&mdash;houses, land, cattle, ivory. It is the practical Christian
who can ... cure their diseases, build dwellings, teach
farming and turn his hand to anything like a sailor&mdash;this is
the man who is wanted. Such a one, if he can be found,
would become the saviour of Africa."</p></div>

<p>Stanley called for "a practical man who could turn
his hand to anything&mdash;<i>if he can be found</i>."</p>

<p>The words burned their way into Mackay's very soul.</p>

<p>"If he can be found." Why here, here in this very
room he sits&mdash;the boy who has worked in the village at
the carpenter's bench and the saddler's table, in the
smithy and the mill, when his mother wished him to be
at his books; the lad who has watched the ships building
in the docks of Aberdeen, and has himself with
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>hammer and file and lathe built and made machines in
the engineering works&mdash;he is here&mdash;the "man who can
turn his hand to anything." And he had, we remember,
already written in his diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Livingstone died&mdash;a Scotsman and a Christian&mdash;loving
God and his neighbour, in the heart of Africa. 'Go thou
and do likewise.'"</p></div>

<p>Mackay did not hesitate. Then and there he took
pen and ink and paper and wrote to London to the
Church Missionary Society which was offering, in the
daily paper that lay before him, to send men out to
King M'tesa. The words that Mackay wrote were
these:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My heart burns for the deliverance of Africa, and if you
can send me to any one of those regions which Livingstone
and Stanley have found to be groaning under the curse of the
slave-hunter I shall be very glad."</p></div>

<p>Within four months Mackay, with some other young
missionaries who had volunteered for the same great
work, was standing on the deck of the S.S. <i>Peshawur</i> as
she steamed out from Southampton for Zanzibar.</p>

<p>He was in the footsteps of Livingstone&mdash;"a Scotsman
and a Christian"&mdash;making for the heart of Africa
and "ready to turn his hand to anything" for the sake
of Him who as</p>

<h4>THE ROADMAKER</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Alexander Mackay</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date, 1878)</p>


<p>After many months of delay at Zanzibar, Mackay
with his companions and bearers started on his tramp
of hundreds of miles along narrow footpaths, often
through swamps, delayed by fierce greedy chiefs who
demanded many cloths before they would let the travellers
pass. One of the little band of missionaries had
already died of fever. When hundreds of miles from
the coast, Mackay was stricken with fever and nearly
died. His companions sent him back to the coast again
to recover, and they themselves went on and put together
the <i>Daisy</i>, the boat which the bearers had carried
in sections on their heads, on the shore of Victoria
Nyanza. So Mackay, racked with fever, was carried
back by his Africans over the weary miles through
swamp and forest to the coast. At last he was well
again, and with infinite labour he cut a great wagon
road for 230 miles to Mpapwa. With pick and shovel,
axe and saw, they cleared the road of trees for a hundred
days.</p>

<p>Mackay wrote home as he sat at night tired by the
side of his half-made road, "This will certainly yet be
a highway for the King Himself; and all that pass this
way will come to know His Name."</p>

<p><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>At length, after triumphing by sheer skill and will
over a thousand difficulties, Mackay reached the southern
shore of Victoria Nyanza at Kagei, to find that
his surviving companions had gone on to Uganda in an
Arab sailing-dhow, leaving on the shore the <i>Daisy</i>,
which had been too small to carry them.</p>

<p>On the beach by the side of that great inland sea,
Victoria Nyanza, in the heart of Africa, Mackay found
the now broken and leaking <i>Daisy</i>. Her cedar planks
were twisted and had warped in the blazing sun till
every seam gaped. A hippopotamus had crunched her
bow between his terrible jaws. Many of her timbers
had crumbled before the still greater foe of the African
boat-builder&mdash;the white ant.</p>

<p>Now, under her shadow lay the man "who could
turn his hand to anything," on his back with hammer
and chisel in hand. He was rivetting a plate of copper
on the hull of the <i>Daisy</i>. Already he had nailed sheets
of zinc and lead on stern and bow, and had driven cotton
wool picked from the bushes by the lake into the
seams to caulk some of the leaks. Around the boat
stood crowds of Africans, their dark faces full of astonishment
at the white man mending his big canoe.</p>

<p>"Why should a man toil so terribly hard?" they wondered.</p>

<p>The tribesmen of the lake had only canoes hollowed
out from a tree-trunk, or made of some planks sewn
together with fibres from the banana tree.</p>

<p>At last Mackay had his boat ready to sail up the
Victoria Nyanza. The whole of the length of that
great sea, itself larger than his own native Scotland,
still separated Mackay from the land of Uganda for
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>which he had left Britain over fifteen months earlier.</p>

<p>All through his disappointments and difficulties
Mackay fought on. With him, as with Livingstone,
nothing had power to break his spirit or quench his
burning determination to carry on his God-given plan
to serve Africa.</p>

<p>Every use of saw and hammer and chisel, every</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"trick of the tool's true trade,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>all the training in the shipbuilding yards and engineering
shops at Edinburgh and in Germany helped Mackay
to invent some new, daring and ingenious way out of
every fresh difficulty.</p>


<p><i>The Wreck of the "Daisy"</i></p>

<p>Now at last the <i>Daisy</i> was on the water again; and
Mackay and his bearers went aboard<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and hoisting
sail from Kagei ran northward. Before they had gone
far black storm clouds swept across the sky. Night
fell. Lightning blazed unceasingly and flung up into
silhouette the wild outlines of the mountains to the east.
The roar of the thunder echoed above the wail of the
wind and the threshing of the waves.</p>

<p>All through the dark, Mackay and those of his men
who could handle an oar rowed unceasingly. Again
and again he threw out his twenty-fathom line, but in
vain. He made out a dim line of precipitous cliffs, yet
the water seemed fathomless&mdash;the only map in existence
was a rough one that Stanley had made. At last
the lead touched bottom at fourteen fathoms. In the
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>dim light of dawn they rowed and sailed toward a
shady beach before the cliffs, and anchored in three and
a half fathoms of water.</p>

<p>The storm passed; but the waves from the open sea
came roaring in and broke over the <i>Daisy</i>. The bowsprit
dipped under the anchor chain, and the whole bulwark
on the weatherside was carried away. The next
sea swept into the open and now sinking boat. By
frantic efforts they heaved up the anchor and the next
wave swung the <i>Daisy</i> with a crash onto the beach,
where the waves pounded her to a complete wreck,
wrenching the planks from the keel. But Mackay and
his men managed to rescue her cargo before she went to
pieces.</p>

<p>They were wrecked on a shore where Stanley, the
great explorer, had years before had a hairbreadth
escape from massacre at the hands of the wild savages.
But Stanley, living up to the practice he had learned
from Livingstone, had turned enemies into friends, and
now the natives made no attack on the shipwrecked
Mackay.</p>

<p>For eight weeks Mackay laboured there, hard on the
edge of the lake, living on the beach in a tent made of
spars and sails. With hammer and chisel and saw he
worked unsparingly at his task. He cut the middle
eight feet from the boat, and bringing her stern and
stem together patched the broken ends with wood from
the middle part. After two months' work the now
dumpier <i>Daisy</i> took the water again, and carried Mackay
and his men safely up the long shores of Victoria
Nyanza to the goal of all his travelling, the capital of
M'tesa, King of Uganda.</p>

<p><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>The rolling tattoo of goat-skin drums filled the royal
reception-hall of King M'tesa, as the great tyrant entered
with his chiefs. M'tesa, his dark, cruel heavy
face in vivid contrast with his spotless white robe, sat
heavily down on his stool of State, while brazen trumpets
sent to him from England blared as Mackay
entered. The chiefs squatted on low stools and on the
rush-strewn mud-floor before the King. At his side
stood his Prime Minister, the Katikiro, a smaller man
than the King, but swifter and more far-sighted. The
Katikiro was dressed in a snowy-white Arab gown covered
by a black mantle trimmed with gold. In his hard,
guilty face treacherous cunning and masterful cruelty
were blended.</p>

<p>M'tesa was gracious to Mackay, and gave him land
on which to build his home. More important to Mackay
than even his hut was his workshop, where he
quickly fixed his forge and anvil, vise and lathe, and
grindstone, for he was now in the place where he could
practise his skill. It was for this that he had left home
and friends, and pressed on in spite of fever and shipwreck
to serve Africa and lead her to the worship of
Jesus Christ by working and teaching as our Lord did
when on earth.</p>

<p>One day the wide thatched roof of that workshop
shaded from the flaming rays of the sun a crowded
circle of the chiefs of Uganda with their slaves, who
loved to come to "hear the bellows roar." They were
gazing at Mackay, whose strong, bare right arm was
swinging his hammer</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Clang-a-clang-clang."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>Then a ruddy glow lit up the dark faces of the watchers
and the bronzed face of the white man who in the
centre of his workshop was blowing up his forge fire.
Gripping in his pincers the iron hoe that was now red-hot,
Mackay hammered it into shape and then plunged
it all hissing into the bath of water that stood by him.</p>

<p>Hardly had the cloud of steam risen from the bath,
when Mackay once more gripped the hoe, and moving
to his grindstone placed his foot on the pedal and set
the edge of the hoe against the whirling stone. The
sparks flew high. A murmur came from the Uganda
chiefs who stood around.</p>

<p>"It is witchcraft," they said to one another. "It is
witchcraft by which Mazunga-wa-Kazi makes the hard
iron tenfold harder in the water. It is witchcraft by
which he sends the wheels round and makes our hoes
sharp. Surely he is the great wizard."</p>

<p>Mackay caught the sound of the new name that they
had given him&mdash;Mazunga-wa-Kazi&mdash;the White-Man-at-Work.
They called him by this name because to
them it was very strange that any man should work
with his own hands.</p>

<p>"Women are for work," said the chiefs. "Men go
to talk with the King, and to fight and eat."</p>

<p>Mackay paused in his work and turned on them.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you are wrong. God made man
with one stomach and with two hands in order that he
may work twice as much as he eats." And Mackay
held out before them his own hands blackened with the
work of the smithy, rough with the handling of hammer
and saw, the file and lathe. "But you," and he
turned on them with a laugh and pointed to their sleek
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>bodies as they shone in the glow of the forge fire, "you
are all stomach and no hands."</p>

<p>They grinned sheepishly at one another under this
attack, and, as Mackay let down the fire and put away
his tools, they strolled off to the hill on which the
King's beehive-shaped thatched palace was built.</p>

<p>Mackay climbed up the hill on the side of which his
workshop stood. From the ridge he gazed over the
low-lying marsh from which the women were bearing
on their heads the water-pots. He knew that the men
and women of the land were suffering from fearful illnesses.
He now realised that the fevers came from the
poisonous waters of the marsh. He made up his mind
how he could help them with his skill. They must have
pure water; yet they knew nothing of wells.</p>

<p>Mackay at once searched the hill-side with his spade
and found a bed of clay emerging from the side of the
hill. He climbed sixteen feet higher up the hill and,
bringing the men who could help him together, began
digging. He knew that he would reach spring water at
the level of the clay, for the rains that had filtered
through the earth would stop there.</p>

<p>The Baganda<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> thought that he was mad. "Whoever,"
they asked one another, "heard of digging in
the top of a hill for water?"</p>

<p>"When the hole is so deep," said Mackay, measuring
out sixteen feet, "water will come, pure and clean, and
you will not need to carry it up the hill from the marsh."</p>

<p>They dug and dug till the hole was too deep to hurl
the earth up over the edge. Then Mackay made a pulley,
which seemed a magic thing to them, for they could
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>not yet understand the working of wheels; and with
rope and bucket the earth was pulled up. Exactly at
the depth of sixteen feet the water welled in. The Baganda
clapped their hands and danced with delight.</p>

<p>"Mackay is the great wizard. He is the mighty
spirit," they cried. "The King must come to see this."</p>

<p>King M'tesa himself wondered at the story of the
making of the well and the finding of the water. He
gave orders that he was to be carried to view this great
wonder. His eyes rolled with astonishment as he saw
it and heard of the wonders that were wrought by the
work of men.</p>

<p>Yet M'tesa and his men still wondered why any man
should work hard. Mackay tried to explain this to the
King when he sat in his reception-hall. Work, Mackay
told M'tesa, is the noblest thing a man can do, and he
told him how Jesus Christ, the Son of the Great Father-Spirit
who made all things, did not Himself feel that
work was a thing too mean for Him. For our Lord,
when He lived on earth at Nazareth, worked with His
own hands at the carpenter's bench, and made all labour
forever noble.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Alexander Mackay</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date, 1878)</p>


<p>In the court of King M'tesa, Mackay always saw
many boys who used to drive away the flies from the
King's face with fans, carry stools for the chiefs and
visitors to squat upon, run messages and make themselves
generally useful. Most of these boys were the
sons of chiefs. When they were not occupied with
some errand, they would lounge about playing games
with one another in the open space just by the King's
hut.</p>

<p>Often when Mackay came to speak with the King,
he had to wait in this place before he could have audience
of M'tesa. He would bring with him large sheets
of paper on which he had printed in his workshop the
alphabet and some sentences. The printing was actually
done with the little hand-press that Mackay had
used in his attic when he was a boy in his old home in
Rhynie. He had taken it with him all the way to
Uganda, and now was setting up letters and sentences
in a language which had never been printed before.</p>

<p>The Baganda boys who had gathered round the
White-Man-of-Work with wondering eyes, as he with
his "magic" printed the sheets of paper, now crowded
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>about him as he unrolled one of these white sheets with
the curious black smudges on them. Mackay made the
noise that we call A and then B, and pointed to these
curious-shaped objects which we call the letters of the
alphabet. Then he got them to make the noise and
point to the letter that represented that sound. At last
the keenest of the boys really could repeat the alphabet
right through and begin to read whole words from another
sheet&mdash;Baganda words&mdash;so that at length they
could read whole sentences.</p>

<p>Two of these pioneer boys became very good scholars.
One named Mukasa became a Christian and was
baptised with the name Samweli (Samuel); another
called Kakumba was baptised Yusufu (Joseph). A
third boy had been captured from a tribe in the north,
and his skin was of a much lighter brown than that of
the Baganda boys. This light-skinned captured slave
was named Lugalama.</p>

<p>Each of these boys felt that it was a very proud day
when at last he could actually read a whole sheet of
printing from beginning to end in his own language&mdash;from
"Our Father" down to "the Kingdom, the power
and the glory, Amen."</p>

<p>One morning these page-boys leapt to their feet as
they heard the familiar rattle of the drums that heralded
the coming of King M'tesa. They bowed as he
entered the hall and sat heavily on his stool, while his
chiefs ranged themselves about him.</p>

<p>On a stool near the King sat Mackay, the White-Man-of-Work.
His bronzed face was set in grim determination,
for he knew that on that morning he had
a difficult battle to fight.</p>

<p><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>Another loud battering of drum-heads filled the air.
The entrance to the hut was darkened by a tall, swarthy
Arab in long, flowing robes, followed by negro-bearers,
who cast on the ground bales of cloth and guns. The
Arab wore on his head a red fez, round which a coloured
turban scarf was wound. He was a slave-trader
from the coast, who had come from the East to M'tesa
in Uganda to buy men and women and children to
carry them away into slavery.</p>

<p>King M'tesa was himself not only a slave-trader but
a slave-raider. He sent his fierce gangs of warriors
out to raid a tribe away in the hills to the north. They
would dash into a village, slay the men, and drag the
boys and girls and women back to M'tesa as slaves.
The bronze-skinned boy, Lugalama, was a young slave
who had been captured on one of these bloodthirsty
raids. And M'tesa, who often sent out his executioners
to slay his own people by the hundred to please the
dreaded and horrible god of small-pox, would also sell
his people by the hundred to get guns for his soldiers.</p>

<p>The Arab slave-trader bowed to the earth before
King M'tesa, who signalled to him to speak.</p>

<p>"I have come," said the Arab, pointing to the guns
on the floor, "to bring you these things in exchange for
some men and women and children. See, I offer you
guns and percussion caps and cloth." And he spread
out lengths of the red cloth, and held out one of the
guns with its gleaming barrel.</p>

<p>King M'tesa's eyes lighted up with desire as he saw
the muskets and the ammunition. These, he thought,
are the things that will make me powerful against my
enemies.</p>

<p><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>"I will give you," the Arab slave-trader went on,
"one of these lengths of red cloth in exchange for one
man to be sold to me as a slave; one of these guns for
two men; and one hundred of these percussion caps for
a woman as a slave."</p>

<p>Mackay looked into the cruel face of M'tesa, and he
could see how the ambitious King longed for the guns.
Should he risk the favour of the King by fighting the
battle of a few slaves? Yet Mackay remembered as
he sat there, how Livingstone's great fight against the
slave-traders had made him, as a student, vow that he
too would go out and fight slavery in Africa. The
memory nerved him for the fight he was now to make.</p>

<p>Mackay turned to M'tesa and said words like these:<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>"O King M'tesa, you are set as father over all your
multitude of people. They are your children. It is
they who make you a great King.</p>

<p>"Remember, O King, that the Sultan of Zanzibar
himself has signed a decree that no slaves shall be taken
in all these lands and sold to other lands down beyond
the coast, whither this Arab would lead your children.
Therefore if you sell slaves you break his law.</p>

<p>"Will you, then, sell your own people that they may
be taken out of their homeland into a strange country?
They will be chained to one another, beaten with whips,
scourged and kicked, and many will be left at the wayside
to die; till the peoples of the coast shall laugh at
Uganda and say, 'That is how King M'tesa lets strangers
treat his children!'"</p>

<p>We can imagine how the Arab turned and scowled
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>fiercely at Mackay. His heart raged, and he would
have given anything to plunge the dagger hidden in his
robe into Mackay's heart. Who was this white man
who dared to try to stop his trade? But Mackay went
on.</p>

<p>"See," he said, pointing to the boys and the chiefs,
"your children are wonderfully made. Their bones,
which are linked together, are clothed with flesh; and
from the heart in their breasts the blood that gives men
life flows to and fro through their bodies, while the
breath goes in and out of their lungs and makes them
live. God the Father and Maker of all men alone can
create such wonders. No men who ever lived could, if
they worked all through their lives, make one thing so
marvellous as one of these boys. Will you, then, sell
one of these miracles, one of your children, for a bit of
red rag which any man can make in a day?"</p>

<p>All eyes turned to King M'tesa to learn what he
would say.</p>

<p>The King with a wave of his hand dismissed the
scowling Arab, while he took counsel with his chiefs,
and came to this decision:</p>

<p>"My people shall no more be made slaves."</p>

<p>A decree was written out and King M'tesa put his
hand to it. The crestfallen Arab and his men gathered
up their guns and cloths, marched down the hill to
buy ivory instead of slaves for their bales of red cloth,
and went out of the dominions of King M'tesa, across
the Great Lake homeward.</p>

<p>Mackay had won the first battle against slavery. His
heart was very glad. Yet he knew that, although he
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>had scored a triumph in this fight with the slave-dealer,
he had not won in his great campaign. The King was
generally kind to Mackay, for he was proud to have so
clever a white man in his country. But he could not
make up his mind to become a Christian. M'tesa's
heart had not really changed. His slave-raiding of
other tribes might still go on. The horrible butcherings
of his people to turn away the dreaded anger of
the gods would continue. Mackay felt he must press
on with his work. He was slowly opening a road
through the jungle of cruelty and the marshes of dread
of the gods that made the life of the Baganda people
dark and dreadful.</p>

<p>All Uganda waited breathless one day as though the
end of the world had come.</p>

<p>"King M'tesa is dead!" the cry went out through all
the land.</p>

<p>The people waited in dread and on tiptoe of eagerness
till the new king was selected by the chiefs from
the sons of the dead ruler.</p>

<p>At last a great cheer went up from the Palace.
"M'wanga has eaten Uganda!" they shouted.</p>

<p>By this the people meant that M'wanga, a young son
of M'tesa&mdash;only eighteen years old&mdash;had been made
King. He was, however, a boy with no power&mdash;the
mere feeble tool of the Katikiro (the Prime Minister)
and of Mujasi, the Captain of the King's own bodyguard
of soldiers. Both of these great men of the kingdom
fiercely hated Mackay, for they were jealous of
his power over the old King. So they whispered into
the young M'wanga's ears stories like this: "You know
that men say that Uganda will be eaten up by an enemy
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>from the lands of the rising sun. Mackay and the
other white men are making ready to bring thousands
of white soldiers into your land to 'eat it up' and to kill
you."</p>

<p>So M'wanga began to refuse to speak to Mackay.
Then, because the King was afraid to attack him, he
began to lay plots against the boys.</p>

<p>One morning Mackay started out from his house
with five or six boys and the crew of his boat to march
down to the lake. Among the boys were young Lugalama&mdash;the
fair-haired slave-boy, now a freed-slave and
a servant to Mackay&mdash;and Kakumba, who had (you
remember) been baptised Joseph. The King and the
Katikiro had given Mackay permission to go down to
the lake and sail across it to take letters to a place called
Msalala from which the carriers would bear them down
to the coast.</p>

<p>Down the hill the party walked, the crew carrying
the baggage and the oars on their heads. Mackay and
his colleague Ashe, who had come out from England
to work with him, walked behind.</p>

<p>To their surprise there came running down the path
behind them and past them a company of soldiers.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Mackay of one of
the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Mujasi, the Captain of the Bodyguard," he replied,
"has sent us to capture some of the King's wives who
have run away."</p>

<p>Another and yet another body of soldiers rushed
past them. Mackay became more and more suspicious
that some foul plot was being brewed. He and his
company had walked ten miles, and the lake was but
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>two miles away, divided from them by a wood. Suddenly
there leapt out from behind the trees of the wood
hundreds of men headed by Mujasi himself.</p>

<p>They levelled their guns and spears at Mackay and
his friends and yelled, "Go back! Go back!"</p>

<p>"We are the King's friends," replied Mackay, "and
we have his leave to travel. How dare you insult us?"</p>

<p>And they pushed forward. But the soldiers rushed
at them; snatched their walking-sticks from them and
began to jostle them. Mackay and Ashe sat down by
the side of the path. Mujasi came up to them.</p>

<p>"Where are you walking?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We are travelling to the port with the permission
of King M'wanga and the Katikiro."</p>

<p>"You are a liar!" replied Mujasi.</p>

<p>Mujasi stood back and the soldiers rushed at the
missionaries, dragged them to their feet and held the
muzzles of their guns within a few inches of their
chests. Mackay turned with his boys and marched
back to the capital.</p>

<p>He and Ashe were allowed to go back to their own
home on the side of the hill, but the five boys were
marched to the King's headquarters and imprisoned.
The Katikiro, when Mackay went to him, refused to
listen at first. Then he declared that Mackay was
always taking boys out of the country, and returning
with armies of white men and hiding them with the intention
of conquering Uganda.</p>

<p>The Katikiro waved them aside and the angry waiting
mob rushed on the missionaries yelling, "Mine shall
be his coat!" "Mine his trousers!" "No, mine!"
shouted another, as the men scuffled with one another.</p>

<p><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>Mackay and Ashe at last got back to their home and
knelt in prayer. Later on the same evening, they decided
to attempt to win back the King and the Prime
Minister and Mujasi by gifts, so that their imprisoned
boys would be freed from danger.</p>

<p>Mackay spoke to his other boys, telling them to go
and fly for their lives or they would be killed.</p>

<p>In the morning Mackay heard that three of the boys
who had been captured on the previous day were not
only bound as prisoners, but that Mujasi was threatening
to burn them to death. The boys were named Seruwanga,
Kakumba, and Lugalama. The eldest was
fifteen, the youngest twelve.</p>

<p>The boys were led out with a mob of howling men
and boys around them. Mujasi shouted to them: "Oh,
you know Isa Masiya (Jesus Christ). You believe
you will rise from the dead. I shall burn you, and you
will see if this is so."</p>

<p>A hideous roar of laughter rose from the mob. The
boys were led down the hill towards the edge of a
marsh. Behind them was a plantation of banana trees.
Some men who had carried bundles of firewood on
their heads threw the wood into a heap; others laid
hold of each of the boys and cut off their arms with
hideous curved knives so that they should not struggle
in the fire.</p>

<p>Seruwanga, the bravest, refused to utter a cry as he
was cut to pieces, but Kakumba shouted to Mujasi, who
was a Mohammedan, "You believe in Allah the Merciful.
Be merciful!" But Mujasi had no mercy.</p>

<p>We are told that the men who were watching held
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>their breath with awed amazement as they heard a
boy's voice out of the flame and smoke singing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Daily, daily sing to Jesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sing, my soul, His praises due."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the executioners came towards the youngest and
feeblest, Lugalama, he cried, "Oh, do not cut off my
arms. I will not struggle, I will not fight&mdash;only throw
me into the fire."</p>

<p>But they did their ghastly work, and threw the mutilated
boy on a wooden framework above the slow fire
where his cries went up, till at last there was silence.</p>

<p>One other Christian stood by named Musali. Mujasi,
with eyes bloodshot and inflamed with cruelty,
came towards him and cried:</p>

<p>"Ah, you are here. I will burn you too and your
household. You are a follower of Isa (Jesus)."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," replied Musali, "and I am not ashamed
of it."</p>

<p>It was a marvel of courage to say in the face of the
executioner's fire and knife what Peter dared not say
when the servant-maid in Jerusalem laughed at him.
Perhaps the heroism of Musali awed even the cruel-hearted
Mujasi. In any case he left Musali alone.</p>

<p>For a little time M'wanga ceased to persecute the
Christians. But the wily Arabs whispered in his ear
that the white men were still trying to "eat up" his
country. M'wanga was filled with mingled anger and
fear. Then his fury burst all bounds when Mujasi
said to him: "There is a great white man coming from
the rising sun. Behind him will come thousands of
white soldiers."</p>

<p><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>"Send at once and kill him," cried the demented
M'wanga.</p>

<p>A boy named Balikudembe, a Christian, heard the
order and he could not contain himself, but broke out,
"Oh, King M'wanga, why are you going to kill a
white man? Your father did not do so."</p>

<p>But the soldiers went out, travelled east along the
paths till they met the great Bishop Hannington being
carried in a litter, stricken with fever. They took him
prisoner, and, after some days, slew him as he stood
defenceless before them. Hannington had been sent
out to help Mackay and his fellow-Christians.</p>

<p>Then the King fell ill. He believed that the boy
Balikudembe, who had warned him not to kill the
Bishop, had bewitched him. So M'wanga's soldiers
went and caught the lad and led him down to a place
where they lit a fire, and placing the boy over it,
burned him slowly to death.</p>

<p>All through this time Mackay alone had not been
really seriously threatened, for his work and what he
was made the King and the Katikiro and even Mujasi
afraid to do him to death.</p>

<p>Then there came a tremendous thunderstorm. A
flash of lightning smote the King's house and it flamed
up and burned to ashes. Then King M'wanga seemed
to go mad. He threatened to slay Mackay himself.</p>

<p>"Take, seize, burn the Christians," he cried. And
his executioners and their minions rushed out, captured
forty-six men and boys, slashed their arms from their
bodies with their cruel curved knives so that they could
not struggle, and then placed them over the ghastly
flames which slowly wrung the lives from their tor<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>tured
bodies. Yet the numbers of the Christians
seemed to grow with persecution.</p>

<p>The King himself beat one boy, Apolo Kagwa, with
a stick and smote him on the head, then knocked him
down, kicked and stamped upon him. Then the King
burned all his books, crying, "Never read again."</p>

<p>The other men and boys who had become Christians
were now scattered over the land in fear of their lives.
Mackay, however, come what may, determined to hold
on. He set his little printing press to work and printed
off a letter which he sent to the scattered Christians.
In Mackay's letter was written these words, "In days
of old Christians were hated, were hunted, were driven
out and were persecuted for Jesus' sake, and thus it is
to-day. Our beloved brothers, do not deny our Lord
Jesus!"</p>

<p>At last M'wanga's mad cruelties grew so frightful
that all his people rose in rebellion and drove him from
the throne, so that he had to wander an outcast by the
lake-side. Mackay at that time was working by the
lake, and he offered to shelter the deposed King who
had only a short time before threatened his life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two years passed; and Mackay, on the lake-side,
was building a new boat in which he hoped to sail to
other villages to teach the people. Then a fever struck
him. He lay lingering for some days. Then he died&mdash;aged
only forty-one.</p>

<p>If Mackay, instead of becoming a missionary, had
entered the engineering profession he might have become
a great engineer. When he was a missionary in
Africa, the British East Africa Company offered him
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>a good position. He refused it. General Gordon offered
him a high position in his army in Egypt. He
refused it.</p>

<p>He held on when his friends and the Church Missionary
Society called him home. This is what he said
to them, "What is this you write&mdash;'Come home'?
Surely now, in our terrible dearth of workers, it is not
the time for anyone to desert his post. Send us only
our first twenty men, and I may be tempted to come to
help you to find the second twenty."</p>

<p>He died when quite young; homeless, after a life in
constant danger from fever and from a half-mad tyrant
king&mdash;his Christian disciples having been burned.</p>

<p>Was it worth while?</p>

<p>To-day the Prime Minister of Uganda is Apolo
Kagwa, who as a boy was kicked and beaten and
stamped upon by King M'wanga for being a Christian;
and the King of Uganda, Daudi, M'wanga's son,
is a Christian. At the capital there stands a fine cathedral
in which brown Baganda clergy lead the prayers
of the Christian people. On the place where the boys
were burned to death there stands a Cross, put there by
70,000 Baganda Christians in memory of the young
martyrs.</p>

<p>Was their martyrdom worth while?</p>

<p>To-day all the slave raiding has ceased for ever;
innocent people are not slaughtered to appease the gods;
the burning of boys alive has ceased.</p>

<p>Mackay began the work. He made the first rough
road and as he made it he wrote: "This will certainly
yet be a highway for the King Himself; and all that
pass this way will come to know His name."</p>

<p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>"And a highway shall be there and a way; and it
shall be a way of holiness."</p>

<p>But the Way is not finished. And the last words
that Mackay wrote were: "Here is a sphere for your
energies. Bring with you your highest education and
your greatest talents, and you will find scope for the
exercise of them all."</p>

<h4>THE BLACK APOSTLE OF THE LONELY LAKE</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Shomolekae</i></p>


<p>In the garden in Africa where, you remember, David
Livingstone plighted troth with Mary Moffat, as they
stood under an almond tree, there lived years ago a
chocolate-skinned, curly-haired boy. His name was
Shomolekae.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>His work was to go among the fruit trees, when the
peaches and apricots were growing and to shout and
make a noise to scare away the birds. If he had not
done this they would have eaten up all the fruit. This
boy was born in Africa over seventy-five years ago,
when Victoria was a young queen.</p>

<p>In the same garden was a grown-up gardener, also
an African, with a dark face and crisp, curly hair. The
grown-up gardener one day stole some of the fruit off
the trees, and he went to the little boy, Shomolekae,
and offered him some apricots.</p>

<p>Now, Shomolekae had learned to love the missionary,
Mr. Mackenzie, who had come to live in the house at
Kuruman. He knew that it was very wrong of the
gardener to steal the fruit and throw the blame on the
birds. So he said that he would not touch the fruit.<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
He went to an old black friend of his named Paul and
said to him:</p>

<p>"The gardener has stolen the apples and plums and
has asked me to eat them. He has robbed Mr. Mackenzie.
I do not know what to do."</p>

<p>And old Paul went and told John Mackenzie, who
took notice of the boy Shomolekae and learned to trust
him.</p>

<p>Many months passed by; and two years later John
Mackenzie was going to a place further north in Africa
than Kuruman. The name of this town was Shoshong,
where Mackenzie would live and teach the people about
Jesus Christ. So he went to the father of Shomolekae,
whose name was Sebolai.</p>

<p>"Sebolai," said John Mackenzie, "I want to take
your son, Shomolekae, with me to Shoshong."</p>

<p>Sebolai replied: "I am willing that my son should
come to live with you, but one thing I desire. It is
that he should be taught his reading and to know the
stories in the Bible and such things."</p>

<p>To this John Mackenzie quickly agreed, for he too
desired that the boy should read.</p>

<p>So the sixteen oxen were yoked to the big wagon,
and amid much shouting and cracking of whips and
lowing of oxen and creaking of wagon-joints, John
Mackenzie, Shomolekae, and the others, started from
Kuruman northward to Shoshong.</p>

<p>Now, at Shoshong the chief was Sekhome, who, you
remember, in our last story, was father to Khama. So
when they were at Shoshong, Shomolekae, the young
man who was cook, and Khama, the young man who
was the son of the chief, worshipped in the same little
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>church together. It was not such a church as you go
to in our country&mdash;but just a little place made of mud
bricks that had been dried in the sun. There were
holes instead of windows, and there was no door in the
open doorway; and on the top of the little building was
a roof of rough, reedy grass.</p>

<p>These were the days that you heard of in the last
story, when Khama, seeing his tribe attacked by the
fierce Lobengula, rode out on horseback at the head of
his regiment of cavalry and fought them and beat
them, and drove away Lobengula with a bullet in his
neck.</p>

<p>For two years Shomolekae, learning to read better
every day, and serving John Mackenzie faithfully in
his house, lived at Shoshong.</p>

<p>Sometimes Shomolekae took long journeys with
wagon and oxen, and at the end of two years he went
with Mackenzie a great way in order to buy windows,
doors, hinges, nails, corrugated iron, and timber with
which to build a better church at Shoshong.</p>

<p>When Shomolekae came back again with the wagons
loaded up there was great excitement in the tribe.
Hammers and saws, screw-drivers and chisels were
busy day after day, and the missionary and his helpers
laid the bricks one upon another until there rose up a
strong church with windows and a door&mdash;a place in
which the people went to worship God the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Again Shomolekae went away by wagon, and this
time he travelled away by the edge of the desert southward
until at last he reached the garden at Kuruman
where as a boy he used to frighten the birds from the
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>fruit trees. He was now a very clever man at driving
wagons and oxen.</p>

<p>This, as you know, is not so easy as driving a wagon
with two horses is in Britain. For there were as many
as sixteen and even eighteen oxen harnessed two by
two to the long iron chains in front of the wagon.</p>

<p>There were no roads, only rough tracks, and the
wagon would drag through the deep sand, or bump
over great boulders of rock, or sink into wet places by
the river. But at such times one of the natives always
led the two front oxen through the river with a long
thong that was fastened to their horns.</p>

<p>So, in order to drive a wagon well, Shomolekae
needed to be able to manage sixteen oxen all at once,
and keep them walking in a straight line. He needed
to know which were the bad-tempered ones and which
were the good, and which pulled best in one part of
the span and which in another; and how to keep them
all pulling together and not lunging at one another
with their horns.</p>

<p>Shomolekae also had to be so bold and daring that,
if lions came to eat the oxen at night, he could go with
the gun and either frighten them away or actually
shoot them.</p>

<p>So you see Shomolekae was very clever, and was full
of good courage.</p>

<p>While he was living at Kuruman a man came to him
one day and said:</p>

<p>"John Mackenzie is alone at Shoshong, and there is
no one who can drive his wagon well for him."</p>

<p>The man who told him this was, as it happened, go<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>ing
by wagon to Shoshong, where John Mackenzie
lived.</p>

<p>"Let me go with you," said Shomolekae.</p>

<p>So he got up into the wagon, and away they went
day after day northward on the same journey that
Shomolekae had taken when he was a boy.</p>

<p>So Shomolekae served Mackenzie for years as
wagon driver at Shoshong.</p>

<p>At last the time came when Mackenzie himself left
the tribe at Shoshong&mdash;left Khama and all his people&mdash;and
travelled southward to build at Kuruman a kind of
small school where he could train young black men to
be missionaries to their own people. And Shomolekae
himself went to Kuruman with Mackenzie. He set to
work with his own hands, and he helped to make and
lay bricks, to put in the doors and windows, and to
place the roof on the walls, until at last the little school
was built.</p>

<p>And when it was actually built Shomolekae himself
went to be a student there, and Mackenzie began to
train him to be a preacher and a teacher to his own
people.</p>

<p>For three years Shomolekae worked hard in the college,
learning more and more about Jesus Christ, preparing
himself to go among his own people to tell them
about Him.</p>

<p>At last the time came when he was ready to go; and
he started out, and travelled long, long miles through
sandy places, and then by a river, until at last he
reached a town of little thatched huts called Pitsani,
which means "The Town of the Little Hyena."</p>

<p>In that town he gathered the men and women and
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>the boys and girls together and taught them the things
that he knew.</p>

<p>While Shomolekae was at Pitsani there came into
that part of Africa a new missionary, whose name was
Mr. Wookey.</p>

<p>It was decided that Mr. Wookey should go a long,
long journey and settle down by the shores of Lake
Ngami, which, you remember, David Livingstone had
discovered long years before.</p>

<p>Shomolekae wished to go out with Mr. Wookey into
this country and to help. So he took the wagon and
yoked the oxen to it, loaded it up with food and all the
things needed for cooking as they travelled along, and
drove the oxen dragging the wagon over many hundreds
of miles of country in which leopards barked and
lions roared, until at last they came to the land near
Lake Ngami.</p>

<p>When they came into this land, and found a place in
which to settle down, clever Shomolekae mixed earth
into mud just as boys and girls do in order to make
mud-pies, but he made the mud into the shape of
bricks, and then placed the bricks of mud out into the
sun to dry.</p>

<p>The sunshine was very, very hot indeed&mdash;so hot
that the bricks became hard and dry and strong. Day
after day Shomolekae worked until he had made a big
heap of bricks. With these he built a little house for
Mr. Wookey to live in. But these sun-dried bricks
soon spoil if they get wet, so he had to build a verandah
to keep the rain from the walls.</p>

<p>When the house was built and Mr. Wookey was set<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>tled
in it, they travelled still further up the river to
learn what people were living there.</p>

<p>After a while it was decided that Shomolekae should
go and live in a small village by the river, and there
again begin his work of telling the men and women
of Jesus Christ, and teaching the boys and girls to
read.</p>

<p>In his satchel, which was made of odd bits of calico
print of different patterns, Shomolekae had a hymn-book
with music. The hymn-book was written in the
language of the people&mdash;the Sechuana language&mdash;and
Shomolekae taught them from the book to sing hymns.
The music was the sol-fa notation.</p>

<p>This is one of the hymns:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. "Yesu oa me oa nthata,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Leha ke le mo dibin;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A re yalo mo kwalon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A re yalo mo pedun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">E, Yesu oa me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E, Yesu oa me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E, Yesu oa me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oa me, mo loraton.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. "Yesu oa me oa nthata,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O ntehetse molato;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O mpusitse timelon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O ntlhapisa mo pedun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"E, Yesu oa me," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is what these words mean in English. I expect
you know them very well.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. "Jesus loves me, this I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For the Bible tells me so;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Little ones to Him belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They are weak, but He is strong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><p><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></p>
<span class="i2">"Yes, Jesus loves me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, Jesus loves me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, Jesus loves me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Bible tells me so.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. "Jesus loves me, He who died<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Heaven's gate to open wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He will wash away my sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let His little child come in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Yes, Jesus loves me," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>But, you see, the missionary had to alter the words
sometimes so as to make the Sechuana lines come right
for the music; and the second verse really means:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My Jesus loves me;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He has paid my debt;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He has brought me back from where I strayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He has washed my heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yes, my Jesus, Yes, my Jesus.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, my Jesus. Mine in love."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They would learn the words off by heart because
there was only the one hymn-book, and they would sing
them together, Shomolekae's voice leading.</p>

<p>They learned them so well that sometimes when the
mothers were out hoeing in the fields, or the little boys
were paddling in their canoes and fishing in the marshy
waters, you would hear them singing the hymns that
they learned in Shomolekae's little school hut.</p>

<p>Then on Sunday they would have Sunday-school,
and when that was over Shomolekae would gather the
chocolate-faced men and women and boys and girls
together&mdash;all who would come&mdash;and he would teach
them to kneel down and pray to the one God, Who is
our Father, and they would sing the hymns that they
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>had learned, and then he would speak to them a simple
little address, telling them of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>But Shomolekae desired always to go further and
further, even though it was dangerous and difficult. So
he got a canoe and launched it in the river by the village
and paddled further and further up the stream,
under the overhanging trees, and sometimes across the
deep pools in which the big and fierce hippopotami and
crocodiles lived.</p>

<p>He paddled up the River Okanvango, though many
times he was in danger of his life. The river was not
like rivers in our own country, deep and with strong
banks; it was often filled all over with reeds, and as
shallow as a swamp, and poor Shomolekae had to push
his way with difficulty through these reeds. Always
at night the poisonous mosquitoes came buzzing and
humming around him. The evil-tempered hippopotamus
would suddenly come up from the bottom of the
river with his wicked beady eyes, and great cavernous
mouth, with its enormous teeth, yawning at Shomolekae
as though he quite meant to swallow him whole.</p>

<p>On the banks at night the lions would roar, and then
the hyenas would howl; but Shomolekae's brave heart
held on, and he pushed on up the river to preach and
teach the people in the villages near the river.</p>

<p>So through many years, with high courage and simple
faith, Shomolekae worked.</p>

<p>A good many boys and girls in England before they
are ten years old own many more books than Shomolekae
ever had and have read more than he. They also
have better homes than he, for he pushed on from one
mud hut to another along the rivers and lakes, and all
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>the possessions that he had in the world could be put
into the bottom of his canoe.</p>

<p>But our Heavenly Father, Who loves you and me,
went with him every step of the way. When Shomolekae
taught the boys and girls to sing hymns in praise
of Jesus, even in a little mud hut, He was there, just
as He is in the most beautiful church when we worship
Him. Now God has taken Shomolekae across the
last river to be with Himself.</p>

<p>Shomolekae was a negro with dark skin and curly
hair. We are white children with fair faces and light
hair. But God is his Father as well as ours and loves
us all alike and wishes to gather us together round Him&mdash;loving
Him and one another.</p>

<h4>THE WOMAN WHO CONQUERED CANNIBALS</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Mary Slessor</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Dates, b. 1848, d. 1915)</p>


<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The Mill-girl</span></h4>

<p><i>The Calabar Girls at the Station</i></p>

<p>As the train from the south slowed down in
Waverley Station, Edinburgh, one day in 1898,
a black face, with eyes wide open with wonder,
appeared at the window. The carriage door opened
and a little African girl was handed down onto the
platform.</p>

<p>The people on the station stopped to glance at the
strange negro face. But as a second African girl a
little older than the first stepped from the carriage to
the platform, and a third, and then a fourth black girl
appeared, the cabmen and porters stood staring in
amused curiosity.</p>

<p>Who was that strange woman (they asked one another),
short and slight, with a face like yellow parchment
and with short, straight brown hair, who smiled
as she gathered the little tribe of African girls round
her on the railway platform?</p>

<p>The telegraph boys and the news-boys gazed at her
in astonishment. But they would have been transfixed
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>with amazement if they had known a tenth of the wonder
of the story of that heroic woman who, just as
simply as she stood there on the Waverley platform,
had mastered cannibals, conquered wild drunken chiefs
brandishing loaded muskets, had faced hunger and thirst
under the flaming heat and burning fevers of Africa,
and walked unscathed by night through forests haunted
by ferocious leopards, to triumph over regiments of
frenzied savages drawn up for battle, had rescued from
death hundreds of baby twins thrown out to be eaten by
ants&mdash;and had now brought home to Scotland from
West Africa four of these her rescued children.</p>

<p>Still more would those Scottish boys at Waverley
Station have wondered, as they gazed on the little
woman and her group of black children, if they had
known that the woman who had done these things,
Mary Slessor, had been a Scottish factory girl, who had
toiled at her weaving machine from six in the morning
till six at night amid the whirr of the belts, the flash
of the shuttles, the rattle of the looms, and the roar
of the great machines.</p>

<p>Born in Aberdeen, December 2, 1848, Mary Slessor
was the daughter of a Scottish shoemaker. Her
mother was a gentle and sweet-faced woman. After her
father's death Mary was the mainstay of the home.
Working in a weaving shed in Dundee (whither the
family moved when Mary was eleven) she educated
herself while at her machine.</p>

<p><i>The Call to Africa</i></p>

<p>Like Livingstone, she taught herself with her book
propped up on the machine at which she worked. She
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>read his travels and heard the stories of his fight against
slavery for Africa, till he became her hero.</p>

<p>One day the news flashed round the world: "Livingstone
is dead. His heart is buried in Central
Africa." Mary had thrilled as she read the story of
his heroic and lonely life. Now he had fallen. She
heard in her heart the words that he had spoken:</p>

<p>"I go to Africa to try to make an open door....;
do you carry out the work which I have begun. I
<span class="smcap">leave it with you</span>."</p>

<p>As Mary sat, tired with her week's work, in her pew
in the church on Sunday, and thought of Livingstone's
call to Africa, she saw visions of far-off places of which
she heard from the pulpit and read in her magazines&mdash;visions
of a steaming river on the West Coast of Africa
where the alligators slid from the mud banks into the
water; visions of the barracoons on the shore in which
the captured negroes were penned as they waited for the
slave-ships; pictures of villages where trembling prisoners
dipped their hands in boiling oil to test their
guilt, and wives were strangled to go with their dead
chief into the spirit-land; visions of the fierce
chiefs who could order a score of men to be beheaded
for a cannibal feast and then sell a hundred more to
be hounded away into the outer darkness of slavery&mdash;the
Calabar where the missionaries of her church were
fighting the black darkness of the most savage people
of the world.</p>

<p>Mary Slessor made up her mind to go out and give
her whole life to Africa. So she offered herself, a
timorous girl who could not cross a field with a cow in
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>it, as a missionary for cannibal Calabar, in West
Africa.</p>

<p>For twelve years she worked at the centre of the mission
in Calabar and then flung herself into pioneer
work among the terrible tribe of Okoyong. No one
had ever been able to influence them. They defied British
administration. For fifteen years she strove there,
and won a power over the ferocious Okoyong savages
such as no one has ever wielded. "I'm a wee, wee
wifie," she said, "no very bookit, but I grip on well
none the less."</p>

<p>To-day over two thousand square miles of forest
and rivers, the dark savages, as they squat at night in
the forest around their palaver-fires, tell one another
stories of the Great-White-Ma-Who-Lived-Alone, and
the stories they tell are like these.</p>


<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Healing of the Chief</span></h4>

<p><i>Through the Forest in the Rain</i></p>

<p>A strange quiet lay over all the village by the river.
For the chief lay ill in his hut. The Calabar people
were waiting on the tip-toe of suspense. For if the
chief died many of them would be slain to go with him
into the spirit-world&mdash;his wives and some of his soldiers
and slaves.</p>

<p>Suddenly a strange African woman, who had come
over from another village, entered the chief's harem.
She spoke to the wives of the chief, saying, "There
lives away through the forest at Ekenge a white Ma
who can cast out by her magic the demons who are
killing your chief. My son's child was dying, but the
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>white Ma<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> saved her and she is well to-day. Many
other wonders has she done by the power of her juju.
Let your chief send for her and he will not die."</p>

<p>There was silence and then eager chattering, for the
women knew that their very lives depended on the chief
getting well. If he died, they would be killed.</p>

<p>They sent in word to the chief about the strange
white Ma.</p>

<p>"Let her be sent for," he ordered. "Send a bottle
and four rods (value about a shilling) and messengers
to ask her to come."</p>

<p>All through the day the messengers hurried over
stream and hill, through village after village and along
the forest paths till at last, after eight hours' journey,
they came to the village of Ekenge. Going to the courtyard
of the chief they told him the story of their sick
chief, and their desire that the white Ma who lived in
his village should come and heal him.</p>

<p>"She will say for herself what she will do," said the
chief.</p>

<p>So he sent a messenger to Mary Slessor. She soon
came over from her little house to learn what was
needed of her.</p>

<p>The story of the sick chief was again told.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with your chief?" asked Mary
Slessor. Blank faces and nodding heads showed that
they knew nothing at all.</p>

<p>"I must go to him," she declared. She knew that
the way was full of perils, and that she might be killed
by warriors and wild beasts; but she knew too that, if
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>she did not go and if the chief died, hundreds of lives
might be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Chief Edem said, "There are warriors out in the
woods and you will be killed. You must not go."</p>

<p>Ma Eme, a tall fat African widow of Ekenge village,
who loved Mary Slessor, said, "No, you must not go.
The streams are deep; the rains are come. You could
never get there."</p>

<p>But Mary Slessor said, "I <i>must</i> go."</p>

<p>"Then I will send women with you to look after you,
and men to protect you," said Chief Edem.</p>

<p>Mary Slessor went back to her house to prepare to
start on her long dangerous journey in the morning.
She could not sleep for wondering whether she was
indeed right to risk her life and all her work on the off-chance
of saving this distant sick chief. She knelt
down and asked God to guide her. Then she felt in her
heart that she must go.</p>

<p>In the morning at dawn a guard of Ekenge women
came to her door.</p>

<p>"The men will join us outside the village," they said.</p>

<p>The skies were grey. The rain was falling as they
started. When the village lay behind them the rain
began to pour in sheets. It came down as only an
African rain can, unceasing torrents of pitiless deluge.
Soon Mary Slessor's soaked boots became impossible
to walk in. She took them off and threw them into
the bush; then her stockings went, and she ploughed on
in the mud in her bare feet.</p>

<p>They had walked for three hours when, as the
weather began to clear, Mary Slessor came out into a
market-place for neighbouring villages. The hundreds
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>of Africans who were bartering in the market-place
turned and stared at the strange white woman who
swiftly passed through their midst and disappeared
into the bush beyond.</p>

<p>So she pressed on for hour after hour, her head
throbbing with fever, her dauntless spirit driving her
trembling, timid body onward till at last, when she had
been walking almost ceaselessly for over eight hours,
she tottered into the village of the sick chief.</p>


<p><i>The Healing Hand.</i></p>

<p>Mary Slessor, aching from head to foot with fever
and overwhelming weariness, did not lie down even
for a moment's rest, but walked straight to the chief
who lay senseless on his mat on the mud floor. Having
examined him she took from her little medicine chest
a drug and gave a dose to the chief. But she could
see at once that more of this medicine was needed than
she had with her. She knew that, away on the other
side of the river, some hours distant, another missionary
was working.</p>

<p>"You must go across the river to Ikorofiong for
more medicine."</p>

<p>"No, no!" they said, "we dare not go. They will
slay any man who goes there."</p>

<p>She was in despair. Then someone said, "There
is a man of that country living in his canoe on the river.
Perhaps he would go?"</p>

<p>They ran down to the river and found him. After
much persuading he at last went, and returned next
day with the medicine.</p>

<p>The chief, whom the women had believed to be
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>almost dead, gradually recovered consciousness, then
sat up and took food. At last he was quite well. All
the village laughed and sang for joy. There would be
no slaying. They gathered round Mary Slessor in
grateful wonder at her magic powers. She told them
that she had come to them because she worshipped the
Great Physician Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father&mdash;God
who made all things. Then she gathered them together
in the morning and evening, and led them as
with bowed heads they all thanked God for the healing
of the chief.</p>


<h4>III. <span class="smcap">Valiant in Fight</span></h4>

<p>Years passed by and Mary Slessor's name was
known in all the villages for many miles. She was,
to them, the white Ma who was brave and wise and
kind. She was mad, they thought, because she was
always rescuing the twin babies whom the Calabar
people throw out to die and the mothers of twins
whom they often kill. But in some strange way they
felt that her wisdom, her skill in healing men, and her
courage, which was more heroic than that of their
bravest warriors, came from the Spirit who made all
things. She would wrench guns from the hands of
drunken savage men who were three times as strong
as she was. At last she used to sit with their chief as
judge of quarrels, and many times in palavers between
villages she stopped the people from going to war.</p>


<p><i>Through the Forest Perilous</i></p>

<p>One day a secret message came to her that, in some
villages far away, a man of one village had wounded
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>the chief in another village and that all the warriors
were arming and holding councils of war.</p>

<p>"I must go and stop it," said Mary Slessor.</p>

<p>"You cannot," said her friends at Ekenge, "the
steamer is coming to take you home to Britain because
you are so ill. You will miss the boat. You are too
ill to walk. The wild beasts in the woods will kill
you. The savage warriors are out, and will kill you in
the dark&mdash;not knowing who you are."</p>

<p>"But I must go," she answered.</p>

<p>The chief insisted that she must have two armed
men with lanterns with her, and that she must get the
chief of a neighbouring village to send out his drummer
with her so that people might know&mdash;as they heard the
drum&mdash;that a protected person was travelling who must
not be harmed.</p>

<p>It was night, and Mary Slessor with her two companions
marched out into the darkness, the lanterns
throwing up strange shadows that looked like fierce
men in the darkness. Through the night they walked
till at midnight they reached the village where they were
to ask for the drum.</p>

<p>The chief was surly.</p>

<p>"You are going to a warlike people," he said. "They
will not listen to what a woman says. You had better
go back. I will not protect you."</p>

<p>Mary Slessor was on her mettle.</p>

<p>"When you think of the woman's power," she said
to the chief, "you forget the power of the woman's
God. I shall go on."</p>

<p>And to the amazement of the savages in the villages
she went on into the darkness. Surely she must be
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>mad. She defied their chief who had the power to
kill her. She had walked on into a forest where ferocious
leopards abounded ready to spring out upon her,
and where men were drinking themselves into a fury
of war. And for what? To try with a woman's
tongue to stop the fiery chiefs and the savages of a
distant warlike tribe from fighting. Surely she was
mad.</p>


<p><i>Facing the Warriors</i></p>

<p>She pressed on through the darkness. Then she saw
the dim outlines of huts. Mary Slessor had reached
the first town in the war area. She found the hut
where an old Calabar woman lived who knew the white
Ma.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" came a whisper from within.</p>

<p>But even as she replied there was a swift patter of
bare feet. Out of the darkness leapt a score of armed
warriors. They were all round her. From all parts
dark shadows sprang forward till scores of men with
their chiefs were jostling, chattering and threatening.</p>

<p>"What have you come for?" they asked.</p>

<p>"I have heard that you are going to war. I have
come to ask you not to fight," she replied.</p>

<p>The chiefs hurriedly talked together, then they came
to her and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The white Ma is welcome. She shall hear all that
we have to say before we fight. All the same we shall
fight. For here you see are men wounded. We <i>must</i>
wipe out the disgrace that is put upon us. Now she
must rest. Women, you take care of the white Ma.
We will call her at cock-crow when we start."</p>

<p><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>This meant an hour's sleep. Mary Slessor lay down
in a hut. It seemed as though her eyes were hardly
shut before she was wakened again. She stood, tottering
with tiredness, when she heard the cry&mdash;</p>

<p>"Run, Ma, run!"</p>

<p>The warriors were off down the hill away to the
fight. She ran, but they were quickly out of sight
on the way to the attack. Was all her trouble in vain?
She pressed on weak and breathless, but determined.
She heard wild yells and the roll of the war drum. The
warriors she had followed were feverishly making
ready to fight, a hundred yards distant from the enemy's
village.</p>

<p>She went up to them and spoke sternly.</p>

<p>"Behave like men," she said, "not like fools. Do
not yell and shout. Hold your peace. I am going into
the village there."</p>

<p>She pointed to the enemy. Then she walked forward.
Ahead of her stood the enemy in unbroken
ranks of dark warriors. They stood like a solid wall.
She hailed them as she walked forward.</p>

<p>There was an ominous silence. She laughed.</p>

<p>"How perfect your manners are!" she exclaimed.
She was about to walk forward and force them to make
way for her when an old chief stepped out toward her
and, to her amazement, knelt down at her feet.</p>

<p>"Ma," he said, "we thank you for coming to us. We
own that we wounded the chief over there. It was only
one of our men who did it. It was not the act of all
our town. We ask you that you will speak with our
enemy to bring them to peace with us."</p>

<p><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><i>The Healed Chief</i></p>

<p>She looked into the face of the chief. Then she saw
to her joy that this was the very chief whom she had
toiled through the rain to heal long ago. Because of
what she had done then, he was now at her feet asking
her to make peace. Should she run back and tell the
warriors, who a hundred yards away were spoiling for
a fight? That was her first joyful thought. Then she
saw that she must first make her authority stronger over
the whole band of warriors.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," she said. "Some of you
find a place where I can sit in comfort; and bring me
food. I will not starve while men fight. Choose two
or three men to speak well for you, and we will have
two men from your enemies."</p>

<p>These grim warriors, so sullen and threatening a
few moments ago, obeyed her every word. At length
two chiefs came from the other side and stood on one
side of her, while the two chiefs chosen in the village
came and threw down their arms and knelt at their
feet.</p>

<p>"Your chief," they said, "was wounded by a drunken
youth. Do not let us shed blood through all our villages
because of what he did. If you will cease from
war with us, we will pay to you any fine that the white
Ma shall say."</p>

<p>She, too, pressed them to stop their fighting. Word
went back to the warriors on both sides, who became
wildly excited. Some agreed, others stormed and
raged till they were in a frenzy. Would they fight even
over her body? Furious warriors came moving up
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>from both sides. But by arguing and appealing at last
she persuaded the warlike tribe to accept a fine.</p>


<p><i>The Promise of Peace</i></p>

<p>The town whose drunken youth had wounded the
enemy chief at once paid a part of the fine. They used
no money. So the fine was paid in casks and bottles
of trade gin. Mary Slessor trembled. For as the
boxes of gin bottles were brought forward the warriors
pranced with excitement and made ready to get drunk.
She knew that this would make them fight after all.
What could she do? The roar of voices rose. She
could not make her own voice heard. A daring idea
flashed into her mind. According to the law of these
Egbo people, clothes thrown over anything give it the
protection of your body. She snatched off her skirt and
all the clothing she could spare and spread them over
the gin. She seized the one glass that the tribe had,
and doled out one portion only to each chief to test
whether the bottles indeed contained spirit. At last
they grew quieter and she spoke to them.</p>

<p>"I am going," she said, "across the Great Waters
to my home, and I shall be away many moons. Promise
me here, on both sides, that you will not go to war
with one another while I am away."</p>

<p>"We promise," they said. They gathered around
her and she told them the story of Jesus Christ in
whose name she had come to them.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "go to your rest and fight no
more." And the tribes kept their promise to her,&mdash;so
that when she returned they could say, "It is peace."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>For nearly forty years she worked on in Calabar,
stricken scores of times with fever. She rescued her
hundreds of twin babies thrown out to die in the forest,
stopped wars and ordeal by poison, made peace, healed
the sick.</p>

<p>At last, too weak to walk, she was wheeled through
the forests and along the valleys by some of her
"twins" now grown to strong children, and died there&mdash;the
conquering Queen of Calabar, who ruled in the
hearts of even the fiercest cannibals through the power
of the Faith, by which out of weakness she was made
strong.</p>

<h4>SONS OF THE DESERT</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Abdallah and Sabat</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Time of Incidents, about 1800-1810)</p>


<p><i>Two Arab Wanderers</i></p>

<p>One day, more than a hundred years ago, two young
Arabs, Abdallah and Sabat, rode on their camels toward
a city that was hidden among the tawny hills standing
upon the skyline.</p>

<p>The sun was beginning to drop toward the edge of
the desert away in the direction of the Red Sea. The
shadows of the long swinging legs of the camels wavered
in grotesque lines on the sand. There was a look
of excited expectation in the eyes of the young Arabs;
for, by sunset, their feet would walk the city of their
dreams.</p>

<p>They were bound for Mecca, the birthplace of Mohammed,
the Holy City toward which every man of
the Mohammedan world turns five times a day as he
cries, "There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is
the prophet of Allah." To have worshipped in Mecca
before the sacred Kaaba and to have kissed the black
stone in its wall&mdash;this was to make Paradise certain
for them both. Having done that pilgrimage these two
Arabs, Sabat and Abdallah, would be able to take the
proud title of "Haji" which would proclaim to every
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>man that they had been to Mecca&mdash;the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>So they pressed on by the valley between the hills
till they saw before them the roofs and the minarets of
Mecca itself. As darkness rushed across the desert
and the stars came out, the tired camels knelt in the
courtyard of the Khan,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and Sabat and Abdallah
alighted and stretched their cramped legs, and took their
sleep.</p>

<p>These young men, Sabat and Abdallah, the sons of
notable Arab chiefs, had struck up a great friendship.
Now, each in company with his chum, they were together
at the end of the greatest journey that an Arab
can take.</p>

<p>As the first faint flush of pink touched the mountain
beyond Mecca, the cry came from the minaret: "Come
to prayer. Prayer is better than sleep. There is no
God but Allah."</p>

<p>Sabat and Abdallah were already up and out, and
that day they said the Mohammedan prayer before the
Kaaba itself with other pilgrims who had come from
many lands&mdash;from Egypt and Abyssinia, from Constantinople
and Damascus, Baghdad and Bokhara, from
the defiles of the Khyber Pass, from the streets of
Delhi and the harbour of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>We do not know what Abdallah looked like. He was
probably like most young Arab chieftains, a tall, sinewy
man&mdash;brown-faced, dark-eyed, with hair and a
short-cropped beard that were between brown and
black.</p>

<p>His friend Sabat was, however, so striking that even
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>in that great crowd of many pilgrims people would
turn to look at him. They would turn round, for one
reason, because of Sabat's voice. Even when he was
just talking to his friend his voice sounded like a roar;
when he got excited and in a passion (as he very
often did) it rolled like thunder and was louder than
most men's shouting. As he spoke his large white
teeth gleamed in his wide mouth. His brown face and
black arched eyebrows were a dark setting for round
eyes that flashed as he spoke. His black beard flowed
over his tawny throat and neck. Gold earrings swung
with his agitation and a gold chain gleamed round his
neck. He wore a bright silk jacket with long sleeves,
and long, loose-flowing trousers and richly embroidered
shoes with turned-up toes. From a girdle round his
waist hung a dagger whose handle and hilt flashed with
jewels.</p>

<p>Abdallah and Sabat were better educated than most
Arabs, for they could both read. But they were not
men who could stay in one place and read and think in
quiet. When they had finished their worship at Mecca,
they determined to ride far away across the deserts
eastward, even to Kabul in the mountains of Afghanistan.
So they rode, first northward up the great camel-route
toward Damascus, and then eastward. In spite
of robbers and hungry jackals, through mountain
gorges, over streams, across the Syrian desert from
oasis to oasis, and then across the Euphrates and the
Tigris they went, till they had climbed rung by rung
the mountain ranges that hold up the great plateau of
Persia.</p>

<p>At last they broke in upon the rocky valleys of Af<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>ghanistan
and came to the gateway of India&mdash;to Kabul.
They presented themselves to Zeman Shah, the ruler
of Afghanistan, and he was so taken with Abdallah's
capacity that he asked him to be one of his officers in
the court. So Abdallah stayed in Kabul. But the restless,
fiery Sabat turned the face of his camel westward
and rode back into Persia to the lovely city of Bokhara.</p>


<p><i>Abdallah the Daring</i></p>

<p>In Kabul there was an Armenian whose name we do
not know: but he owned a book printed in Arabic, a
book that Abdallah could read. The Armenian lent it
to him. There were hardly any books in Arabic, so
Abdallah took this book and read it eagerly. As he
read, he thought that he had never in all his life heard
of such wonderful things, and he could feel in his very
bones that they were true. He read four short true
stories in this book: they were what we call the Gospels
according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. As
he read, Abdallah saw in the stories Someone who was
infinitely greater than Mohammed&mdash;One who was so
strong and gentle that He was always helping children
and women and people who were ill; so good that He
always lived the very life that God willed; and so brave
that He died rather than give in to evil men&mdash;our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"I worship Him," said Abdallah in his heart. Then
he did a very daring thing. He knew that if he turned
Christian it would be the duty of Mohammedans to kill
him. Why not keep quiet and say nothing about his
change of heart? But he could not. He decided that
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>he must come out in the open and confess the new
Captain of his life. He was baptized a Christian.</p>

<p>The Moslems were furious. To save his life Abdallah
fled on his camel westward to Bokhara. But the
news that he had become a Christian flew even faster
than he himself rode. As he went along the streets of
Bokhara he saw his friend Sabat coming toward him.
As a friend, Sabat desired to save Abdallah; but as a
Moslem, the cruel law of Mohammed said that he
must have him put to death. And Sabat was a fiery,
hot-tempered Moslem.</p>

<p>"I had no pity," Sabat told his friends afterward.
"I delivered him up to Morad Shah, the King."</p>

<p>So Abdallah was bound and carried before the Moslem
judges. His friend Sabat stood by watching, just
as Saul had stood watching them stone Stephen nearly
eighteen centuries earlier.</p>

<p>"You shall be given your life and be set free," they
said, "if you will spit upon the Cross and renounce
Christ and say, 'There is no God but Allah.'"</p>

<p>"I refuse," said Abdallah.</p>

<p>A sword was brought forward and unsheathed. Abdallah's
arm was stretched out: the sword was lifted&mdash;it
flashed&mdash;and Abdallah's hand, cut clean off, fell on
the ground, while the blood spurted from his arm.</p>

<p>"Your life will still be given you if you renounce
Christ and proclaim Allah and Mohammed as His
prophet."</p>

<p>This is how Sabat himself described what happened
next. "Abdallah made no answer, but looked up steadfastly
toward heaven, like Stephen, the first martyr,
his eyes streaming with tears. He looked at me," said<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>
Sabat, "but it was with the countenance of forgiveness."</p>

<p>Abdallah's other arm was stretched out, again the
sword flashed and fell. His other hand dropped to the
ground. He stood there bleeding and handless. He
bowed his head and his neck was bared to the sword.
Again the blade flashed. He was beheaded, and Sabat&mdash;Sabat
who had ridden a thousand miles with his
friend and had faced with him the blistering sun of the
desert and the snow-blizzard of the mountain&mdash;saw Abdallah's
head lie there on the ground and the dead body
carried away.</p>

<p>Abdallah had died because he was faithful to Jesus
Christ and because Sabat had obeyed the law of Mohammed.</p>


<p><i>The Old Sabat and the New</i></p>

<p>The news spread through Bokhara like a forest fire.
They could hardly believe that a man would die for the
Christian faith like that. As Sabat told his friends
afterward, "All Bokhara seemed to say, 'What new
thing is this?'"</p>

<p>But Sabat was in agony of mind. Nothing that he
could do would take away from his eyes the vision of
his friend's face as Abdallah had looked at him when
his hands were being cut off. He plunged out on to the
camel tracks of Asia to try to forget. He wandered far
and he wandered long, but he could not forget or find
rest for his tortured mind.</p>

<p>At last he sailed away on the seas and landed on the
coast of India at Madras. The British East India Company
then ruled in India, and they gave Sabat a post in
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>the civil courts as mufti, <i>i.e.</i> as an expounder of the
law of Mohammed. He spent most of his time in a
coast town north of Madras, called Vizagapatam.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> A
friend handed to him there a little book in his native
language&mdash;Arabic. It was another translation of
those stories that Abdallah had read in Kabul&mdash;it was
the New Testament.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Sabat sat reading this New Book. He then took up
the book of Mohammed's law&mdash;the Koran&mdash;which it
was his daily work to explain. He compared the two.
"The truth came"&mdash;as he himself said&mdash;"like a flood
of light." He too began to worship Jesus Christ,
whose life he had read now for the first time in the
New Testament. Sabat decided that he must follow in
Abdallah's footsteps. He became a Christian.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> He
was then twenty-seven years of age.</p>


<p><i>The Brother's Dagger</i></p>

<p>In the world of the East news travels like magic by
Arab dhow (sailing ship) and camel caravan. Very
quickly the news was in Arabia that Sabat had renounced
Mohammed and become a Christian. At once
Sabat's brother rose, girded on his dagger, left the tents
of his tribe, mounted his camel and coursed across
Arabia to a port. There he took ship for Madras.
Landing, he disguised himself as an Indian and went up
to Vizagapatam to the house where his brother Sabat
was living.</p>

<p>Sabat saw this Indian, as he appeared to be, standing
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>before him. He suspected nothing. Suddenly the disguised
brother put his hand within his robe, seized his
dagger, and leaping at Sabat made a fierce blow at him.
Sabat flung out his arm. He spoilt his brother's aim,
but he was too late to save himself. He was wounded,
but not killed. The brother threw off his disguise,
and Sabat&mdash;remembering the forgiveness of Abdallah&mdash;forgave
his brother, gave him many presents, and
sent loving messages to his mother.</p>

<p>Sabat decided that he could no longer work as an
expounder of Moslem law: he wanted to do work that
would help to spread the Christian Faith. He went
away north to Calcutta, and there he joined the great
men who were working at the task of translating the
Bible into different languages and printing them. This
work pleased Sabat, for was it not through reading an
Arabic New Testament that all his own life had been
changed?</p>

<p>Because Sabat knew Persian as well as Arabic he was
sent to help a very clever young chaplain from England
named Henry Martyn, who was busily at work translating
the New Testament into Persian and Arabic. So
Sabat went up the Ganges to Cawnpore with Henry
Martyn.</p>

<p>Sabat's fiery temper nearly drove Martyn wild. His
was a flaming Arab spirit, hot-headed and impetuous;
yet he would be ready to die for the man he cared for;
proud and often ignorant, yet simple&mdash;as Martyn said,
"an artless child of the desert."</p>

<p>Sabat's knowledge of Persian was not really so good
as he himself thought it was, and some of the Indian
translators at Calcutta criticised his translation. At
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>this he got furiously angry, and, like St. Peter, the
fiery, impetuous apostle, he denied Jesus Christ and
spoke against Christianity.</p>

<p>With his heart burning with rage and his great voice
thundering with anger, Sabat left his friends, went
aboard ship and sailed down the Bay of Bengal by the
Indo-Chinese coast till he came to Penang, where he
began to live as a trader.</p>

<p>But by this time the fire of his anger had burnt itself
out. He&mdash;again like Peter&mdash;remembered his denial of
his Master, and when he saw in a Penang newspaper
an article saying that the famous Sabat, who had become
a Christian and then become a Mohammedan
again, had come to live in their city, he wrote a letter
which was published in the newspaper at Penang declaring
that he was now&mdash;and for good and all&mdash;a
Christian.</p>

<p>A British officer named Colonel MacInnes was stationed
at Penang. Sabat went to him. "My mind is
full of great sorrow," he said, "because I denied Jesus
Christ. I have not had a moment's peace since Satan
made me do that bad work. I did it for revenge. I
only want to do one thing with my life: to spend it in
undoing this evil that has come through my denial."</p>

<p>Sabat left the house of the Mohammedan with whom
he was living in Penang. He found an old friend of
his named Johannes, an Armenian Christian merchant,
who had lived in Madras in the very days when Sabat
first became a Christian. Every night Johannes the
Armenian and Sabat the Arab got out their Bibles, and
far into the night Sabat would explain their meaning
to Johannes.</p>

<p><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><i>The Prince from Sumatra</i></p>

<p>One day all Penang was agog with excitement because
a brown Prince from Acheen, a Malay State in
the island of Sumatra, had suddenly sailed into the
harbour. He was in flight from his own land, where
rebels had attacked him. The people of Acheen were
wild and ferocious; many of them were cannibals.</p>

<p>"I will join you in helping to recover your throne,"
said Sabat to the fugitive Prince. "I am going," said
Sabat to Colonel MacInnes, "to see if I can carry the
message of Christianity to this fierce people."</p>

<p>So Sabat and the Prince, with others, went aboard
a sailing ship and crossed the Strait of Malacca to
Sumatra. They landed, and for long the struggle with
the rebels swayed from side to side. The Prince was so
pleased with Sabat that he made him his Prime Minister.
But the struggle dragged on and on; there
seemed to be no hope of triumph. At last Sabat decided
to go back to Penang. One day he left the
Prince and started off, but soldiers of the rebel-chief
Syfoolalim captured him.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of the rebels&mdash;their powerful
enemy was in their hands! They bound him, threw
him into a boat, hoisted him aboard a sailing ship and
clapped him in the stifling darkness of the hold. As he
lay there he pierced his arm to make it bleed, and, with
the blood that came out, wrote on a piece of paper that
was smuggled out and sent to Penang to Colonel MacInnes.</p>

<p>The agonies that Sabat suffered in the gloom and
filth of that ship's hold no one will ever know. We can
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>learn from the words that he wrote in the blood from
his own body that they loaded worse horrors upon him
because he was a Christian. All the scene is black, but
out of the darkness comes a voice that makes us feel
that Sabat was faithful at the end. In his last letter to
Colonel MacInnes he told how he was now ready (like
his friend Abdallah) to die for the sake of that Master
whom he had in his rage denied.</p>

<p>Then one day his cruel gaolers came to the hold
where he lay, and, binding his limbs, thrust him into a
sack, which they then closed. In the choking darkness
of the sack he was carried on deck and dragged to the
side of the ship. He heard the lapping of the waves.
He felt himself lifted and then hurled out into the air,
and down&mdash;down with a crash into the waters of the
sea, which closed over him for ever.</p>

<h4>A RACE AGAINST TIME</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Henry Martyn</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Dates, b. 1781, d. 1812. Time of Incident 1810-12)</p>


<p>In the story of Sabat that was told in the previous
chapter you will remember that, for a part of the time
that he lived in India, he worked with an Englishman
named Henry Martyn.</p>

<p>Sabat was almost a giant; Henry Martyn was slight
and not very strong. Yet&mdash;as we shall see in the story
that follows&mdash;Henry Martyn was braver and more
constant than Sabat himself.</p>

<p>As a boy Henry, who was born and went to school in
Truro, in Cornwall, in the West of England, was violently
passionate, sensitive, and physically rather
fragile, and at school was protected from bullies by a
big boy, the son of Admiral Kempthorne.</p>

<p>He left school at the age of fifteen and shot and
read till he was seventeen. In 1797 he became an undergraduate
at St. John's College, Cambridge. He was
still very passionate.</p>

<p>For instance, when a man was "ragging" him in the
College Hall at dinner, he was so furious that he flung
a knife at him, which stuck quivering in the panelling
of the wall. Kempthorne, his old friend, was at Cambridge
with him. They used to read the Bible to<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>gether
and Martyn became a real Christian and fought
hard to overcome his violent temper.</p>

<p>He was a very clever scholar and became a Fellow of
Jesus College in 1802. He at that time took orders in
the Church of England. He became very keen on reading
about missionary work, e.g. Carey's story of nine
years' work in <i>Periodical Accounts</i>, and the L.M.S.
Report on Vanderkemp in South Africa. "I read nothing
else while it lasted," he said of the Vanderkemp
report.</p>

<p>He was accepted as a chaplain of the East India
Company. They could not sail till Admiral Nelson
gave the word, because the French were waiting to capture
all the British ships. Five men-of-war convoyed
them when they sailed in 1805. They waited off Ireland,
because the immediate invasion of England by
Napoleon was threatened. On board Martyn worked
hard at Hindustani, Bengali and Portuguese. He already
knew Greek, Latin and Hebrew. He arrived at
Madras (South India) and Calcutta and thence went
to Cawnpore. It is at this point that our yarn begins.</p>

<p>A voice like thunder, speaking in a strange tongue,
shouted across an Indian garden one night in 1809.</p>

<p>The new moon, looking "like a ball of ebony in an
ivory cup,"&mdash;as one who was there that night said&mdash;threw
a cold light over the palm trees and aloes, on the
man who was speaking and on those who were seated
around him at the table in the bungalow.</p>

<p>Beyond the garden the life of Cawnpore moved in its
many streets; the shout of a donkey-driver, the shrill
of a bugle from the barracks broke sharply through
the muffled sounds of the city. The June wind, heavy
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>with the waters of the Ganges which flows past Cawnpore,
made the night insufferably hot. But the heat
did not trouble Sabat, the wild son of the Arabian desert,
who was talking&mdash;as he always did&mdash;in a roaring
voice that was louder than most men's shouting. He
was telling the story of Abdallah's brave death as a
Christian martyr.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Quietly listening to Sabat's voice&mdash;though he could
not understand what he was saying&mdash;was a young Italian,
Padre Julius C&aelig;sar, a monk of the order of the
Jesuits. On his head was a little skull-cap, over his
body a robe of fine purple satin held with a girdle of
twisted silk.</p>

<p>Near him sat an Indian scholar&mdash;on his dark head a
full turban, and about him richly-coloured robes. On
the other side sat a little, thin, copper-coloured Bengali
dressed in white, and a British officer in his scarlet and
gold uniform, with his wife, who has told us the story
of that evening.</p>

<p>Not one of these brightly dressed people was, however,
the strongest power there. A man in black
clothes was the real centre of the group. Very slight
in build, not tall, clean-shaven, with a high forehead
and sensitive lips, young Henry Martyn seemed a stripling
beside the flaming Arab. Yet Sabat, with all his
sound and fury, was no match for the swift-witted,
clear-brained young Englishman. Henry Martyn was
a chaplain in the army of the East India Company,
which then ruled in India.</p>

<p>He was the only one of those who were listening to
Sabat who could understand what he was saying.<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>
When Sabat had finished his story, Martyn turned, and,
in his clear, musical voice translated it from the Persian
into Latin mixed with Italian for Padre Julius C&aelig;sar,
into Hindustani for the Indian scholar, into Bengali
for the Bengal gentleman, and into English for the
British officer and his wife. Martyn could also talk to
Sabat himself both in Arabic and in Persian.</p>

<p>As Martyn listened to the rolling sentences of Sabat,
the Christian Arab, he seemed to see the lands beyond
India, away across the Khyber Pass, where Sabat had
travelled&mdash;Mesopotamia, Arabia, Persia.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn knew that in all those lands the people
were Mohammedans. He wanted one thing above
everything else in the world: that was to give them all
the chance of doing what Sabat and Abdallah had
done&mdash;the chance of reading in their own languages the
one book in the world that could tell them that God was
a Father&mdash;the book of letters and of biographies that
we call the New Testament.</p>


<p><i>The Toil of Brain</i></p>

<p>There was not in the world a copy of the New Testament
in good Persian. To make one Henry Martyn
slaved hard, far into the hot, sultry Indian nights, with
scores of mosquitoes "pinging" round his lamp and
his head, grinding at his Persian grammar, so that he
could translate the life of Jesus Christ into that language.</p>

<p>Even while he was listening to Sabat's story in the
bungalow at Cawnpore, Martyn knew that he was so
ill that he could not live for many years more. The
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>doctor said that he must leave India for a time to be
in a healthier place. Should he go home to England,
where all his friends were? He wanted that; but much
more he wanted to go on with his work. So he asked
the doctor if he might go to Persia on the way home,
and he agreed.</p>

<p>So Martyn went down from Cawnpore to Calcutta,
and in a boat down the Hoogli river to the little Arab
coasting sailing ship the <i>Hummoudi</i>, which hoisted sail
and started on its voyage round India to Bombay.
Martyn read while on board the Old Testament in the
original Hebrew and the New Testament in the original
Greek, so that he might understand them better
and make a more perfect translation into Persian. He
read the Koran of Mohammed so that he could argue
with the Persians about it. And he worked hard
at Arabic grammar, and read books in Persian. Yet
he was for ever cracking jokes with his fellow travellers,
cooped up in the little ship on the hot tropical
seas.</p>

<p>From Bombay the governor granted Martyn a passage
up the Persian Gulf in the <i>Benares</i>, a ship in the
Indian Navy that was going on a cruise to finish the
exciting work of hunting down the fierce Arab pirates
of the Persian Gulf. So on Lady Day, 1811, the sailors
got her under weigh and tacked northward up the Gulf,
till at last, on May 21, the roofs and minarets of Bushire
hove in sight. Martyn, leaning over the bulwarks,
could see the town jutting out into the Gulf on a spit
of sand and the sea almost surrounding it. That day
he set foot for the first time on the soil of Persia.</p>

<p><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><i>Across Persia on a Pony</i></p>

<p>Aboard ship Martyn had allowed his beard and moustache
to grow. When he landed at Bushire he bought
and wore the clothes of a Persian gentleman, so that
he should escape from attracting everybody's notice by
wearing clothes such as the people had never seen before.</p>

<p>No one who had seen the pale, clean-shaven clergyman
in black silk coat and trousers in Cawnpore would
have recognised the Henry Martyn who rode out that
night on his pony with an Armenian servant, Zechariah
of Isfahan, on his long one hundred and seventy mile
journey from Bushire to Shiraz. He wore a conical
cap of black Astrakhan fur, great baggy trousers of
blue, bright red leather boots, a light tunic of chintz,
and over that a flowing cloak.</p>

<p>They went out through the gates of Bushire on to the
great plain of burning sand that stretched away for
ninety miles ahead of them. They travelled by night,
because the day was intolerably hot, but even at midnight
the heat was over 100 degrees. It was a fine
moonlight night; the stars sparkled over the plain. The
bells tinkled on the mules' necks as they walked across
the sand. All else was silent.</p>

<p>At last dawn broke. Martyn pitched his little tent
under a tree, the only shelter he could get. Gradually
the heat grew more and more intense. He was already
so ill that it was difficult to travel.</p>

<p>"When the thermometer was above 112 degrees&mdash;fever
heat," says Martyn, "I began to lose my strength
fast. It became intolerable. I wrapped myself up in
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>a blanket and all the covering I could get to defend
myself from the air. By this means the moisture was
kept a little longer upon the body. I thought I should
have lost my senses. The thermometer at last stood
at 126 degrees. I concluded that death was inevitable."</p>

<p>At last the sun went down: the thermometer crept
lower: it was night and time to start again. But
Martyn had not slept or eaten. He could hardly sit
upright on his pony. Yet he set out and travelled on
through the night.</p>

<p>Next morning he had a little shelter of leaves and
branches made, and an Arab poured water on the
leaves and on Martyn all day to try to keep some of
the frightful heat from him. But even then the heat
almost slew him. So they marched on through another
night and then camped under a grove of date palms.</p>

<p>"I threw myself on the burning ground and slept,"
Martyn wrote. "When the tent came up I awoke in a
burning fever. All day I had recourse to the wet
towel, which kept me alive, but would allow of no
sleep."</p>

<p>At nine that night they struck camp. The ground
threw up the heat that it had taken from the sun during
the day. So frightfully hot was the air that even at
midnight Martyn could not travel without a wet towel
round his face and neck.</p>

<p>As the night drew on the plain grew rougher: then it
began to rise to the foothills and mountains. At last
the pony and mules were clambering up rough steep
paths so wild that there was (as Martyn said) "nothing
to mark the road but the rocks being a little more worn
in one place than in another." Suddenly in the dark<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>ness
the pony stopped; dimly through the gloom Martyn
could see that they were on the edge of a tremendous
precipice. A single step more would have plunged him
over, to be smashed on the rocks hundreds of feet
below. Martyn did not move or try to guide the beast:
he knew that the pony himself was the safest guide.
In a minute or two the animal moved, and step by step
clambered carefully up the rock-strewn mountain-side.</p>

<p>At last they came out on the mountain top, but only
to find that they were on the edge of a flat high plain&mdash;a
tableland. The air was pure and fresher; the mules
and the travellers revived. Martyn's pony began to
trot briskly along. So, as dawn came up, they came in
sight of a great courtyard built by the king of that
country to refresh pilgrims.</p>

<p>Through night after night they tramped, across
plateau and mountain range, till they climbed the third
range, and then plunged by a winding rocky path into a
wide valley where, at a great town called Kazrun, in a
garden of cypress trees was a summer-house.</p>

<p>Martyn lay down on the floor but could not sleep,
though he was horribly weary. "There seemed," he
said, "to be fire within my head, my skin like a cinder."
His heart beat like a hammer.</p>

<p>They went on climbing another range of mountains,
first tormented by mosquitoes, then frozen with cold;
Martyn was so overwhelmed with sleep that he could
not sit on his pony and had to hurry ahead to keep
awake and then sit down with his back against a rock
where he fell asleep in a second, and had to be shaken
to wake up when Zechariah, the Armenian mule driver,
came up to where he was.</p>

<p><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>They had at last climbed the four mountain rungs of
the ladder to Persia, and came out on June 11th, 1811,
on the great plain where the city of Shiraz stands.
Here he found the host Jaffir Ali Khan, to whom he
carried his letters of introduction. Martyn in his
Persian dress, seated on the ground, was feasted with
curries and rice, sweets cooled with snow and perfumed
with rose water, and coffee.</p>

<p>Ali Khan had a lovely garden of orange trees, and in
the garden Martyn sat. Ill as he was, he worked day
in and day out to translate the life of Jesus Christ in
the New Testament from the Greek language into pure
and simple Persian. The kind host put up a tent for
Martyn in the garden, close to some beautiful vines,
from which hung lovely bunches of purple grapes. By
the side of his tent ran a clear stream of running water.
All the evening nightingales sang sweetly and mournfully.</p>

<p>As he sat there at his work, men came hundreds of
miles to talk with this holy man, as they felt him to be.
Moslems&mdash;they yet travelled even from Baghdad and
Bosra and Isfahan to hear this "infidel" speak of Jesus
Christ, and to argue as to which was the true religion.
Prince Abbas Mirza invited him to come to speak with
him; and as Martyn entered the Prince's courtyard a
hundred fountains began to send up jets of water in his
honour.</p>

<p>At last they came to him in such numbers that
Martyn was obliged to say to many of them that he
could not see them. He hated sending them away.
What was it forced him to do so?</p>

<p><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><i>The Race against Time</i></p>

<p>It was because he was running a race against time.
He knew that he could not live very long, because the
disease that had smitten his lungs was gaining ground
every day. And the thing that he had come to Persia
for&mdash;the object that had made him face the long voyage,
the frightful heat and the freezing cold of the journey,
the life thousands of miles from his home in Cornwall&mdash;was
that he might finish such a translation of
the New Testament into Persian that men should love
to read years and years after he had died.</p>

<p>So each day Martyn finished another page or two of
the book, written in lovely Persian letters. He began
the work within a week of reaching Shiraz, and in seven
months (February, 1812) it was finished. Three more
months were spent in writing out very beautiful copies
of the whole of the New Testament in this new translation,
to be presented to the Shah of Persia and to the
heir to the throne, Prince Abbas Mirza.</p>

<p>Then he started away on a journey right across
Persia to find the Shah and Prince so that he might give
his precious books to them. On the way he fell ill with
great fever; he was so weak and giddy that he could not
stand. One night his head ached so that it almost drove
him mad; he shook all over with fever; then a great
sweat broke out. He was almost unconscious with
weakness, but at midnight when the call came to start
he mounted his horse and, as he says, "set out, rather
dead than alive." So he pressed on in great weakness
till he reached Tabriz, and there met the British Ambassador.</p>

<p><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>Martyn was rejoiced, and felt that all his pains were
repaid when Sir Gore Ouseley said that he himself
would present the Sacred Book to the Shah and the
Prince. When the day came to give the book to Prince
Abbas, poor Henry Martyn was so weak that he could
not rise from his bed. Before the other copy could be
presented to the Shah, Martyn had died. This is how
it came about.</p>


<p><i>The Last Trail</i></p>

<p>His great work was done. The New Testament was
finished. He sent a copy to the printers in India. He
could now go home to England and try to get well
again. He started out on horseback with two Armenian
servants and a Turkish guide. He was making
along the old track that has been the road from Asia to
Europe for thousands of years. His plan was to travel
across Persia, through Armenia and over the Black Sea
to Constantinople, and so back to England.</p>

<p>For forty-five days he moved on, often going as
much as ninety miles, and generally as much as sixty in
a day. He slept in filthy inns where fleas and lice
abounded and mosquitoes tormented him. Horses,
cows, buffaloes and sheep would pass through his sleeping-room,
and the stench of the stables nearly poisoned
him. Yet he was so ill that often he could hardly keep
his seat on his horse.</p>

<p>He travelled through deep ravines and over high
mountain passes and across vast plains. His head
ached till he felt it would split; he could not eat; fever
came on. He shook with ague. Yet his remorseless<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>
Turkish guide, Hassan, dragged him along, because he
wanted to get the journey over and go back home.</p>

<p>At last one day Martyn got rest on damp ground in
a hovel, his eyes and forehead feeling as though a great
fire burnt in them. "I was almost frantic," he wrote.
Martyn was, in fact, dying; yet Hassan compelled him
to ride a hundred and seventy miles of mountain track
to Tokat. Here, on October 6th, 1812, he wrote in his
journal:</p>

<p>"No horses to be had, I had an unexpected repose.
I sat in the orchard and thought with sweet comfort
and peace of my God&mdash;in solitude my Company, my
Friend, my Comforter."</p>

<p>It was the last word he was ever to write.</p>

<p>Alone, without a human friend by him, he fell asleep.
But the book that he had written with his life-blood,
the Persian New Testament, was printed, and has told
thousands of Persians in far places, where no Christian
man has penetrated, that story of the love of God that
is shown in Jesus Christ.</p>

<h4>THE MOSES OF THE ASSYRIANS</h4>

<p class='center'><i>William Ambrose Shedd</i></p>

<p class='center'>(1865-1918)</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>A dark-haired American with black, penetrating eyes
that looked you steadily in the face, and sparkled with
light when he laughed, sat on a chair in a hall in 1918
in the ancient city of Urumia in the land of Assyria
where Persia and Turkey meet.</p>

<p>His face was as brown with the sunshine of this
eastern land as were the wrinkled faces of the turbaned
Assyrian village men who stood before him. For he
was born out here in Persia on Mount Seir.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> And he
had lived here as a boy and a man, save for the time
when his splendid American father had sent him to
Marietta, Ohio, for some of his schooling, and to
Princeton for his final training. His dark brown moustache
and short beard covered a firm mouth and a
strong chin. His vigorous expression and his strongly
Roman nose added to the commanding effect of his
presence.</p>

<p>A haunting terror had driven these ragged village
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>people into the city of Urumia, to ask help of this wonderful
American leader whom they almost worshipped
because he was so strong and just and good.</p>

<p>For the bloodthirsty Turks and the even more cruel
and wilder Kurds of the mountains were marching on
the land. The Great War was raging across the world
and even the hidden peoples of this distant mountain
land were swept into its terrible flames.</p>

<p>For Urumia city lies to the west of the southern end
of the extremely salt lake of the same name. It is about
150 miles west from the Caspian Sea and the same distance
north of the site of ancient Nineveh. It stands on
a small plain and in that tangle of lakes, mountains and
valley-plains where the ambitions of Russia, Persia
and Turkey have met, and where the Assyrians (Christians
of one of the most ancient churches in the world,
which in the early centuries had a chain of missions
from Constantinople right across Asia to Peking), the
Kurds (wild, fierce Moslems), the Persians, the Turks
and the Russians struggled together.</p>

<p>In front of Dr. William Ambrose Shedd there stood
an old man from the villages. His long grey hair and
beard and his wrinkled face were agitated as he told
the American his story. The old man's dress was covered
with patches&mdash;an eyewitness counted thirty-seven
patches&mdash;all of different colours on one side of his
cloak and loose baggy trousers.</p>

<p>"My field in my village I cannot plough," he said,
"for we have no ox. The Kurds have taken our possessions,
you are our father. Grant us an ox to plough
and draw for us."</p>

<p>Dr. Shedd saw that the old man spoke truth; he
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>scribbled a few words on a slip of paper and the old
man went out satisfied.</p>

<p>So for hour after hour, men and women from all the
country round came to this strange missionary who
had been asked by the American Government to administer
relief, yes, and to be the Consul representing
America itself in that great territory.</p>

<p>They came to him from the villages where, around
the fire in the Khans at night, men still tell stories of
him as one of the great hero-leaders of their race.
These are the kind of stories that they tell of the courage
and the gentleness of this man who&mdash;while he was
a fine American scholar&mdash;yet knew the very heart of
the Eastern peoples in northwestern Persia as no American
has ever done in all our history.</p>

<p>"One day," says one old village Assyrian greybeard,
"Dr. Shedd was sitting at meat in his house when
his servant, Meshadi, ran into the room crying, 'The
Kurds have been among our people. They have taken
three girls, three Christian girls, and are carrying them
off. They have just passed the gate.' The Kurds
were all bristling with daggers and pistols. Dr. Shedd
simply picked up the cane that he holds in his hand
when he walks. He hurried out of the house with
Meshadi, ran up the hill to the Kurd village that lies
there, entered, said to the fierce Kurds, 'Give back
those girls to us.' And they, as they looked into his
face, could not resist him though they were armed and
he was not. So they gave the Assyrian girls back to
him and he led them down the hill to their homes."</p>

<p>So he also stood single-handed between Turks and
five hundred Assyrians who had taken refuge in the
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>missionary compound, and stopped the Turks from
massacring the Christians.</p>

<p>But even as he worked in this way the tide of the
great war flowed towards Urumia. The people there
were mostly Assyrians with some Armenians; they
were Christians. They looked southward across the
mountains to the British Army there in Mesopotamia
for aid.</p>

<p>But, as the Assyrians looked up from Urumia to the
north they could already see the first Turks coming
down upon the city. Thousands upon thousands of the
Assyrians from the country villages crowded into the
city and into the American missionary compound, till
actually even in the mission school-rooms they were
sleeping three deep&mdash;one lot on the floor, another lot
on the seats of the desks and a third on the top of the
desks themselves.</p>

<p>"Hold on; resist; the help of the British will come,"
said Dr. Shedd to the people. "Agha Petros with a
thousand of our men has gone to meet the British and
he will come back with them and will throw back the
Turks."</p>

<p>The Turks and the Kurds came on from the north;
many of the Armenian and Assyrian men were out
across the plains to the east getting in the harvest; and
no sign of succour came from the south.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Through the fierce hot days of July the people held
on because Dr. Shedd said that they must; but at last
on the afternoon of July 30th there came over all the
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>people a strange irresistible panic. They gathered all
their goods together and piled them in wagons&mdash;food,
clothes, saucepans, jewelry, gold, silver, babies, old
women, mothers,&mdash;all were huddled and jumbled together.</p>

<p>The wagons creaked, the oxen lurched down the
roads to the south, the little children cried with hunger
and fright, the boys trudged along rather excited at the
adventure yet rather scared at the awful hullabaloo
and the strange feeling of horror of the cruel Kurdish
horsemen and of the crafty Turk.</p>

<p>Dr. Shedd made one last vain effort to persuade the
people to hold on to their city; but it was impossible&mdash;they
had gone, as it seemed, mad with fright.</p>

<p>He and his wife went to bed that night but not to
sleep. At two o'clock the telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>"The Turks and Kurds are advancing; all the people
are leaving," came the message.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to hold on any longer," said Dr.
Shedd to his wife. "I will go and tell all in the compound.
You get things ready."</p>

<p>Mrs. Shedd got up and began to collect what was
needed: she packed up food (bread, tea, sugar, nuts,
raisins and so on), a frying pan, a kettle, a saucepan,
water jars, saddles, extra horse-shoes, ropes, lanterns, a
spade and bedding. By 7.30 the baggage wagon and
two Red Cross carts were ready. Dr. Shedd and Mrs.
Shedd got up into the wagon; the driver cried to his
horses and they started.</p>

<p>As they went out of the city on the south the Turks
and Kurds came raging in on the north. Within two
hours the Turks and Kurds were crashing into houses
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>and burning them to the ground; but most of the people
had gone&mdash;for Dr. Shedd was practically the last to
leave Urumia.</p>

<p>Ahead of them were the Armenians and Syrians in
flight. They came to a little bridge&mdash;a mass of sticks
with mud thrown over them. Here, and at every
bridge, pandemonium reigned. This is how Mrs.
Shedd describes the scene:</p>

<p>"The jam at every bridge was indescribable confusion.
Every kind of vehicle that you could imagine&mdash;ox
carts, buffalo wagons, Red Cross carts, troikas,
foorgans like prairie schooners, hay-wagons, Russian
pha&euml;tons and many others invented and fitted up for the
occasion. The animals&mdash;donkeys, horses, buffaloes,
oxen, cows with their calves, mules and herds of thousands
of sheep and goats."</p>

<p>All through the day they moved on, at the end of
the procession&mdash;Dr. Shedd, planning out how he could
best get his people safely away from the Turks who&mdash;he
knew&mdash;would soon come pursuing them down the
plain to the mountains. Night fell and they were in a
long line of wagons close to a narrow bridge built by
the Russians across the Baranduz river. They had
come some eighteen miles from Urumia.</p>

<p>So they lay down in the wagons to try to sleep. But
they could not and at two o'clock in the night they
moved on, crossed the river and drove on for hour
after hour toward the mountains that rose in a wall
before them.</p>

<p>The poor horses were not strong so the wagon had
to be lightened. Assyrian boys took loads on their
heads and trudged up the rocky mountain road while
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>the wagon jolted and groaned as it bumped its way
along. The trail of the mountain pass was littered with
samovars (tea urns), copper kettles, carpets, bedding;
and here and there the body of someone who had died
on the way. At the very top of the pass lay a baby
thrown aside there and just drawing its last breath.</p>

<p>So for two days they jolted on hardly getting an
hour's sleep. At last at midday on the third day they
left Hadarabad at the south end of Lake Urumia. Two
hours later the sound of booming guns was heard. A
horseman galloped up.</p>

<p>"The Turks are in Hadarabad," he said. "They are
attacking the rear of the procession."</p>

<p>"It seemed," said Mrs. Shedd, "as if at any moment
we should hear the screams of those behind, as the
enemy fell upon them."</p>

<p>The wagons hurried on to the next town called Memetyar
and there Dr. Shedd waited, lightening his own
wagons by throwing away everything that they could
spare&mdash;oil, potatoes, charcoal, every box except his
Bible and a small volume of Browning's Poems.</p>

<p>Then they started again, along a road that was littered
with the discarded goods of the people. Then
they saw on the road-side a little baby girl that had
been left by her parents. She was not a year old and
sat there all alone in a desolate spot. Left to die. Dr.
Shedd looked at his wife and she at him.</p>

<p>He pulled up the horse and jumped down, picked up
the baby and put her in the wagon. They went along
till they came to a large village. Here they found a
Kurdish mother.</p>

<p>"Take care of this little girl till we come back," said<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>
Dr. Shedd, "and here is some money for looking after
her. We will give you more when we come back if she
is well looked after."</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Suddenly cannon were fired from the mountains and
the people in panic threw away their goods and hurried
in a frenzy of fear down the mountain passes. They
passed on to the plain, and then as they were in a village
guns began to be fired. Three hundred Turks and Persians
were attacking under Majdi&mdash;Sultana of Urumia.
Dr. Shedd, riding his horse, gathered together some
Armenian and Assyrian men with guns and stayed
with them to help them hold back the enemy, while the
women drove on. He was a good target sitting up there
on his horse; but without thinking of his own danger
he kept his men at it. For he felt like a shepherd with
a great flock of fleeing sheep whom it was his duty to
protect.</p>

<p>Panic seized the people. Strong men left their old
mothers to die. Mothers dropped their babies and ran.</p>

<p>"One of my school-girls," Mrs. Shedd says, "afterward
told me how she had left her baby on the bank
and waded with an older child through the river when
the enemy were coming after them. She couldn't carry
both. The memory of her deserted baby is always with
her."</p>

<p>The line of the refugees stretched for miles along
the road. The enemy fired from behind boulders on
the mountain sides. The Armenians and Syrians fired
back from the road or ran up the mountains to chase
them. It was hopeless to think of driving the enemy
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>off but Dr. Shedd's object was to hold them off till
help came. So he went up and down on his horse encouraging
the men; while the bullets whizzed over the
wagons.</p>

<p>"I feared," said Mrs. Shedd, "that the enemy might
get the better of us and we should have to leave the
carts and run for our lives. While they were plundering
the wagons and the loads we would get away. I
looked about me to see what we might carry. There
was little May, six years old (the daughter of one of
their Syrian teachers) who had unconcernedly curled
herself up on the seat for a nap. I wrapped a little
bread in a cloth, put my glasses in my pocket, and took
the bag of money so that I should be ready on a moment's
notice for Dr. Shedd if they should swoop down
upon us."</p>

<p>All day long the firing went on from the mountain
side as the tired horses pulled along the rough trail.
The sun began to sink toward the horizon. What
would happen in the darkness?</p>

<p>Then they saw ahead of them coming from the south
a group of men in khaki. They were nine British
Tommies with three Lewis guns under Captain Savage.
They had come ahead from the main body that had
moved up from Baghdad in order to defend the rear of
the great procession. The little company of soldiers
passed on and the procession moved forward. That
tiny company of nine British Tommies ten miles farther
on was attacked by hundreds of Turks. All day they
held the road, like Horatius on the bridge, till at night
the Cavalry came up and drove off the enemy, and at
last the Shedds reached the British camp.</p>

<p><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>"Why are you right at the tail end of the retreat?"
asked one of the Syrian young men who had hurried
forward into safety.</p>

<p>"I would much rather be there," said Dr. Shedd with
some scorn in his voice, "than like you, leave the unarmed,
the sick, the weak, the women and the children
to the mercy of the enemy."</p>

<p>He was rejoiced that the British had come.</p>

<p>"There was," said Mrs. Shedd, "a ring in his voice,
a light in his eyes, a buoyancy in his step that I had
not seen for months."</p>

<p>He had shepherded his thousands and thousands of
boys and girls, and men and women through the mountains
into the protection of the British squadron of
troops.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Later that day Dr. Shedd began to feel the frightful
heat of the August day so exhausting that he had to
lie down in the cart, which had a canvas cover open
at both ends and was therefore much cooler than a tent.
He got more and more feverish. So Mrs. Shedd got
the Assyrian boys to take out the baggage and she made
up a bed for him on the floor of the cart.</p>

<p>The English doctor was out with the cavalry who
were holding back and dispersing the Turkish force.</p>

<p>Then a British officer came and said: "We are moving
the camp forward under the protection of the
mountains."</p>

<p>It was late afternoon. The cart moved forward
into the gathering darkness. Mrs. Shedd crouched
beside her husband on the floor of the cart attending
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>to him, expecting the outriders to tell her when they
came to the British Camp.</p>

<p>For hours the cart rolled and jolted over the rough
mountain roads. At last it stopped, it was so dark
they could not see the road. They were in a gully and
could not go forward.</p>

<p>"Where is the British camp?" asked Mrs. Shedd.</p>

<p>"We passed it miles back on the road," was the reply.</p>

<p>It was a terrible blow: the doctor, the medicines, the
comfort, the nursing that would have helped Dr. Shedd
were all miles away and he was so ill that it was impossible
to drive him back over that rough mountain
track in the inky darkness of the night.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but just stay where they
were, send a messenger to the camp for the doctor, and
wait for the morning.</p>

<p>"Only a few drops of oil were left in the lantern,"
Mrs. Shedd tells us, "but I lighted it and looked at Mr.
Shedd. I could see that he was very sick indeed and
asked two of the men to go back for the doctor. It was
midnight before the doctor reached us.</p>

<p>"The men," Mrs. Shedd continues, "set fire to a
deserted cart left by the refugees and this furnished
fire and light all night. They arranged for guards in
turn and lay down to rest on the roadside. Hour after
hour I crouched in the cart beside my husband massaging
his limbs when cramps attacked him, giving him
water frequently, for while he was very cold to the
touch, he seemed feverish. We heated the hot water
bottle for his feet, and made coffee for him at the blaze;
we had no other nourishment. He got weaker and
weaker, and a terrible fear tugged at my heart.</p>

<p><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>"Fifty thousand hunted, terror-stricken refugees had
passed on; the desolate, rocky mountains loomed above
us, darkness was all about us and heaven seemed too
far away for prayer to reach. A deserted baby wailed
all night not far away. When the doctor came he gave
two hypodermic injections and returned to the camp
saying we should wait there for him to catch up to us
in the morning. After the injections Mr. Shedd rested
better but he did not again regain consciousness.</p>

<p>"When the light began to reveal things, I could see
the awful change in his face, but I could not believe
that he was leaving me. Shortly after light the men
told me that we could not wait as they heard fighting
behind and it was evident the English were attacked,
so in his dying hour we had to take him over the rough,
stony road. After an hour or two Capt. Reed and the
doctor caught up to us. We drew the cart to the side
of the road where soon he drew a few short, sharp
breaths&mdash;and I was alone."</p>

<p>So the British officers, with a little hoe, on the mountain
side dug the grave of this brave American shepherd,
who had given his life in defending the Assyrian
flock from the Turkish wolf. They made the grave just
above the road beside a rock; and on it they sprinkled
dead grass so that it might not be seen and polluted by
the enemy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The people Dr. Shedd loved were safe. The enemy,
whose bullets he had braved for day after day, was
defeated by the British soldiers. But the great American
leader, whose tired body had not slept while the
Assyrians and Armenians were being hunted through
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>the mountains, lies there dreamless on the mountain
side.</p>

<p>These are words that broke from the lips of Assyrian
sheiks when they heard of his death:</p>

<p>"He bore the burdens of the whole nation upon his
shoulders to the last breath of his life.</p>

<p>"As long as we obeyed his advice and followed his
lead we were safe and prosperous, but when we ceased
to do that destruction came upon us. He was, and ever
will be, the Moses of the Assyrian people."</p>

<p>He lies there where his heart always was&mdash;in that
land in which the Turk, the Assyrian, the Armenian,
the Persian, the Russian and the Arab meet; he is there
waiting for the others who will go out and take up the
work that he has left, the work of carrying to all those
eastern peoples the love of the Christ whom Dr. Shedd
died in serving.</p>

<h4>AN AMERICAN NURSE IN THE GREAT WAR</h4>

<p class='center'><i>E.D. Cushman</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Time 1914-1920)</p>


<p><i>The Turk in Bed</i></p>

<p>The cold, clear sunlight of a winter morning on the
high plateau of Asia Minor shone into the clean, white
ward of a hospital in Konia (the greatest city in the
heart of that land). The hospital in which the events
that I am going to tell in this story happened is supported
by Christian folk in America, and was established
by two American medical missionaries, Dr. William
S. Dodd, and Dr. Wilfred Post, with Miss Cushman,
the head nurse, sharing the general superintendence:
other members of the staff are Haralambos,
their Armenian dispenser and druggist, and Kleoniki, a
Greek nurse trained by Miss Cushman. The author
spent the early spring of 1914 at the hospital in Konia,
when all the people named above were at work there.</p>

<p>The tinkle of camel-bells as a caravan of laden beasts
swung by, the quick pad-pad of donkeys' hoofs, the
howl of a Turkish dog, the cry of a child&mdash;these and
other sounds of the city came through the open window
of the ward.</p>

<p>On a bed in the corner of the ward lay a bearded man&mdash;a
Turk&mdash;who lived in this ancient city of Konia (the<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>
Iconium of St. Paul's day). His brown face and grizzled
beard were oddly framed in the white of the spotless
pillow and sheets.</p>

<p>His face turned to the door as it opened and the
matron entered. The eyes of the Turk as he lay there
followed her as she walked toward one of her deft,
gentle-handed assistant nurses who, in their neat uniforms
with their olive-brown faces framed in dark
hair, went from bed to bed tending the patients; giving
medicine to a boy here, shaking up a pillow for a sick
man there, taking a patient's temperature yonder. Those
skilled nurses were Armenian girls. The Armenians
are a Christian nation, who have been ruled by the
Turks for centuries and often have been massacred by
them; yet these Armenian girls were nursing the Turks
in the hospital. But the matron of the hospital was not
a Turk, nor an Armenian. She had come four thousand
miles across the sea to heal the Turks and the Armenians
in this land. She was an American.</p>

<p>The Turk in bed turned his eyes from the nurses to a
picture on the wall. A frown came on his face. He
began to mutter angry words into his beard.</p>

<p>As a Turk he had always been taught, even as a little
boy, that the great Prophet Mohammed had told them
they must have no pictures of prophets, and he knew
from what he had heard that the picture on the wall
showed the face of a prophet. It was a picture of a
man with a kind, strong face, dressed in garments of
the lands of the East, and wearing a short beard. He
was stooping down healing a little child. It was our
Lord Jesus Christ the Great Physician.</p>

<p>As Miss Cushman&mdash;for that was the name of the
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>matron&mdash;moved toward his bed, the Turk burst into
angry speech.</p>

<p>"Have that picture taken down," he said roughly,
pointing to it. She turned to look at the picture and
then back at him, and said words like these: "No, that
is the picture of Jesus, the great Doctor who lived long
ago and taught the people that God is Love. It is because
He taught that, and has called me to follow in
His steps, that I am here to help to heal you."</p>

<p>But the Turk, who was not used to having women
disobey his commands, again ordered angrily that
the picture should be taken down. But the American
missionary-nurse said gently, but firmly: "No, the
picture must stay there to remind us of Jesus. If you
cannot endure to see the picture there, then if you wish
you may leave the hospital, of course."</p>

<p>And so she passed on. The Turk lay in his bed and
thought it over. He wished to get well. If the doctors in
this hospital&mdash;Dr. Dodd and Dr. Post&mdash;did not attend
him, and if the nurses did not give him his medicine, he
would not. He therefore decided to make no more fuss
about the picture. So he lay looking at it, and was
rather surprised to find in a few days that he liked
to see it there, and that he wanted to hear more and
more about the great Prophet-Doctor, Jesus.</p>

<p>Then he had another tussle of wills with Miss Cushman,
the white nurse from across the seas. It came
about in this way. Women who are Mohammedans
keep their faces veiled, but the Armenian Christian
nurses had their faces uncovered.</p>

<p>"Surely they are shameless women," he thought in
his heart. "And they are Armenians too&mdash;Christian
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>infidels!" So he began to treat them rudely. But the
white nurse would not stand that.</p>

<p>Miss Cushman went and stood by his bed and said:
"I want you to remember that these nurses of mine are
here to help you to get well. They are to you even as
daughters tending their father; and you must behave
to them as a good father to good daughters."</p>

<p>So the Turk lay in bed and thought about that also.
It took him a long time to take it in, for he had always
been taught to hate the Armenians and to think low
thoughts about their womenfolk. But in the end he
learnt that lesson also.</p>

<p>At last the Turk got well, left his bed, and went
away. He was so thankful that he was better that he
was ready to do just anything in the world that Miss
Cushman wanted him to do. The days passed on in the
hospital, and always the white nurse from across the
seas and the Armenian nurses tended the Turkish and
other patients, and healed them through the heats of
that summer.</p>


<p><i>War and Massacre</i></p>

<p>As summer came near to its end there broke on the
world the dreadful day when all Europe went to war.
Miss Cushman's colleagues, the American doctors at
the hospital, left Konia for service in the war. Soon
Turkey entered the war. The fury of the Turks
against the Armenians burst out into a flame. You
might see in Konia two or three Turks sitting in the
shadow of a little saddler's shop by the street smoking
their hubble-bubble water-pipes, and saying words like
these:</p>

<p><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>"The Armenians are plotting to help the enemies of
Turkey. We shall have to kill them all."</p>

<p>"Yes, wipe them out&mdash;the accursed infidels!"</p>

<p>The Turks hate the Armenians because their religion,
Islam, teaches them to hate the "infidel" Christians;
they are of a foreign race and foreign religion in countries
ruled by Turks, though the Armenians were there
first, and the Armenians are cleverer business men than
the Turks, who hate to see their subjects richer than
themselves, and hope by massacre to seize Armenian
wealth.</p>

<p>Yet all the time, as the wounded Turks were sent
from the Gallipoli front back to Konia, the Armenian
nurses in the hospital there were healing them. But the
Turkish Government gave its orders. Vile bands of
Turkish soldiers rushed down on the different cities and
villages of the Armenians.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> One sunny morning a
troop of Turkish soldiers came dashing into a quiet
little Armenian town among the hills. An order was
given. The Turks smashed in the doors of the houses.
A father stood up before his family; a bayonet was
driven through him and soldiers dashed over his dead
body; they looted the house; they smashed up his home;
others seized the mother and the daughters&mdash;the mother
had a baby in her arms; the baby was flung on the
ground and then picked up dead on the point of a
bayonet; and, though the mother and daughters were
not bayoneted then, it would have been better to die at
once than to suffer the unspeakable horrors that came
to them.</p>

<p><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>And that happened in hundreds of villages and cities
to hundred of thousands of Armenians, while hundreds
of thousands more scattered down the mountain passes
in flight towards Konia.</p>


<p><i>The Orphan Boys and Girls</i></p>

<p>As Miss Cushman and her Armenian nurses looked
out through the windows of the hospital, their hearts
were sad as they saw some of these Armenian refugees
trailing along the road like walking skeletons. What
was to happen to them? It was very dangerous for
anyone to show that they were friends with the Armenians,
but the white matron was as brave as she was
kind; so she went out to do what she could to help
them.</p>

<p>One day she saw a little boy so thin that the bones
seemed almost to be coming through his skin. He was
very dirty; his hair was all matted together; and there
were bugs and fleas in his clothes and in his hair. The
hospital was so full that not another could be taken in.
But the boy would certainly die if he were not looked
after properly. His father and his mother had both
been slain by the Turks; he did not know where his
brothers were. He was an orphan alone in all the
world.</p>

<p>Miss Cushman knew Armenian people in Konia, and
she went to one of these homes and told them about
the poor boy and arranged to pay them some money for
the cost of his food. So she made a new home for
him. The next day she found another boy, and then a
girl, and so she went on and on, discovering little
orphan Armenian boys and girls who had nobody to
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>care for them, and finding them homes&mdash;until she had
over six hundred orphans being cared for. It is certain
that nearly all of them would have died if she had not
looked after them.</p>

<p>So Miss Cushman gathered the six hundred Armenian
children together into an orphanage, that was
half for the boys and half for the girls. She was a
hundred times better than the "Woman who Lived in a
Shoe," because, though she had so many children, she
<i>did</i> know what to do. She taught them to make nearly
everything for themselves. In the mornings you would
see half the boys figuring away at their sums or learning
to write and read, while the other boys were hammering
and sawing and planing at the carpenter's
bench; cutting leather and sewing it to make shoes for
the other boys and girls; cutting petrol tins up into
sheets to solder into kettles and saucepans; and cutting
and stitching cloth to make clothes. A young American
Red Cross officer who went to see them wrote home,
"The kids look happy and healthy and as clean as a
whistle."</p>


<p><i>The People on the Plain</i></p>

<p>As Miss Cushman looked out again from the hospital
window she saw men coming from the country into the
city jogging along on little donkeys.</p>

<p>"In the villages all across the plain," they said to her,
"are Armenian boys and girls, and men and women.
They are starving. Many are without homes, wandering
about in rags till they simply lie down on the
ground, worn out, and die."</p>

<p>Miss Cushman sent word to friends far away in<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>
America, and they sent food from America to Turkey
in ships, and a million dollars of money to help the
starving children. So Miss Cushman got together her
boys and girls and some other helpers, and soon they
were very busy all day and every day wrapping food
and clothes into parcels.</p>

<p>Next a caravan of snorting camels came swinging in
to the courtyard and, grumbling and rumbling, knelt
down, to be loaded up. The parcels were done up in
big bales and strapped on to the camels' backs. Then
at a word from the driver the camels rose from their
knees and went lurching out from Konia into the country,
over the rough, rolling tracks, to carry to the people
the food and clothes that would keep them alive.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing is that these camels were led by
a Turk belonging to the people who hate the Armenians,
yet he was carrying food and clothes to them! Why
did this Turk in Konia go on countless journeys, travelling
over thousands of miles with tens of thousands of
parcels containing wheat for bread and new shirts and
skirts and other clothes for the Armenians whom he
had always hated, and never lose a single parcel?</p>

<p>Why did he do it?</p>

<p>This is the reason. Before the war when he was ill
in the hospital Miss Cushman had nursed him with the
help of her Armenian girls, and had made him better;
he was so thankful that he would just run to do anything
that she wished him to do.</p>


<p><i>To Stay or not to Stay?</i></p>

<p>But at last Miss Cushman&mdash;worn out with all this
work&mdash;fell ill with a terrible fever. For some time it
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>was not certain that she would not die of it; for a whole
month she lay sick in great weakness. President Wilson
had at this time broken off relations between America
and Turkey. The Turk now thought of the American
as an enemy; and Miss Cushman was an American.
She was in peril. What was she to do?</p>

<p>"It is not safe to stay," said her friends. "You will
be practically a prisoner of war. You will be at the
mercy of the Turks. You know what the Turk is&mdash;as
treacherous as he is cruel. They can, if they wish, rob
you or deport you anywhere they like. Go now while
the path is open&mdash;before it is too late. You are in the
very middle of Turkey, hundreds of miles from any
help. The dangers are terrible."</p>

<p>As soon as she was well enough Miss Cushman went
to the Turkish Governor of Konia, a bitter Mohammedan
who had organised the massacre of forty thousand
Armenians, to say that she had been asked to go back
to America.</p>

<p>"What shall you do if I stay?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I beg you to stay," said the Governor. "You shall
be protected. You need have no fear."</p>

<p>"Your words are beautiful," she replied. "But if
American and Turkey go to war you will deport me."</p>

<p>If she stayed she knew the risks under his rule. She
was still weak from her illness. There was no colleague
by her side to help her. There seemed to be
every reason why she should sail away back to America.
But as she sat thinking it over she saw before her
the hospital full of wounded soldiers, the six hundred
orphans who looked to her for help, the plain of a hun<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>dred
villages to which she was sending food. No one
could take her place.</p>

<p>Yet she was weak and tired after her illness and, in
America, rest and home, friends and safety called to
her.</p>

<p>"It was," she wrote later to her friends, "a heavy
problem to know what to do with the orphans and other
helpless people who depended on me for life."</p>

<p>What would you have done? What do you think
she did? For what reason should she face these perils?</p>

<p>Not in the heat of battle, but in cool quiet thought,
all alone among enemies, she saw her path and took it.
She did not count her life her own. She was ready to
give her life for her friends of all nations. She decided
to stay in the heart of the enemies' country and serve
her God and the children. Many a man has had the
cross of Honour for an act that called for less calm
courage. That deed showed her to be one of the great
undecorated heroes and heroines of the lonely path.</p>

<p>So she stayed on.</p>

<p>From all over the Turkish Empire prisoners were
sent to Konia. There was great confusion in dealing
with them, so the people of Konia asked Miss Cushman
to look after them; they even wrote to the Turkish
Government at Constantinople to tell them to write to
her to invite her to do this work. There was a regular
hue and cry that she should be appointed, because
everyone knew her strong will, her power of organising,
her just treatment, her good judgment, and her loving
heart. So at last she accepted the invitation. Prisoners
of eleven different nationalities she helped&mdash;including
British, French, Italian, Russian, Indians and Arabs.<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>
She arranged for the nursing of the sick, the feeding of
the hungry, the freeing of some from prison.</p>

<p>She went on right through the war to the end and
beyond the end, caring for her orphans, looking after
the sick in hospital, sending food and clothes to all parts
of the country, helping the prisoners. Without caring
whether they were British or Turkish, Armenian or
Indian, she gave her help to those who needed it. And
because of her splendid courage thousands of boys and
girls and men and women are alive and well, who&mdash;without
her&mdash;would have starved and frozen to death.</p>

<p>To-day, in and around Konia (an Army officer who
has been there tells us), the people do not say, "If
Allah wills," but "If Miss Cushman wills!" It is that
officer's way of letting us see how, through her brave
daring, her love, and her hard work, that served everybody,
British, Armenian, Turk, Indian, and Arab, she
has become the uncrowned Queen of Konia, whose
bidding all the people do because she only cares to serve
them, not counting her own life dear to her.</p>

<h4>ON THE DESERT CAMEL TRAIL</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Archibald Forder</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Time of Incident 1900-1901)</p>


<p><i>The Boy Who Listened</i></p>

<p>An eight-year-old schoolboy sat one evening in a
crowded meeting in Salisbury, his eyes wide open with
wonder as he heard a bronzed and bearded man on the
platform telling of his adventures in Africa. The man
was Robert Moffat.</p>

<p>It was a hot summer night in August (1874). The
walls of the building where the meeting was held
seemed to have disappeared and the boy Archibald
Forder could in imagination see "the plain of a thousand
villages," that Livingstone had seen when this
same Robert Moffat had called him to Africa many
years before. As the boy Archibald heard Moffat he
too wished to go out into the foreign field. Many
things happened as he grew up; but he never forgot that
evening.</p>

<p>At the age of thirteen he left home and was apprenticed
to the grocery and baking business. In 1888 he
married. At this time he read in a magazine about
missionary work in Kerak beyond the River Jordan&mdash;in
Moab among the Arabs&mdash;where a young married
man ready to rough it was needed. He sailed with his
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>wife for Kerak on September 3, 1891, and left Jerusalem
by camel on September 30, on the four days'
journey across Jordan to Kerak. Three times they
were robbed by brigands on this journey. Mr. Forder
worked there till 1896. He then left and travelled
through America to secure support for an attempt to
penetrate Central Arabia with the first effort to carry
the Gospel of Jesus Christ there.</p>

<p>The story that follows tells how Forder made his
pioneer journey into the Arabian desert.</p>


<p><i>The Adventure into the Desert</i></p>

<p>Two pack-horses were stamping their hoofs impatiently
outside a house in Jerusalem in the early morning
a week or two before Christmas.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Inside the house
a man was saying good-bye to his wife and his three
children. He was dressed as an Arab, with a long
scarf wrapped about his head and on the top the black
rope of twisted goats' hair that the Arab puts on when
he becomes a man.</p>

<p>"Will you be long, Father?" asked his little four-year-old
boy.</p>

<p>The father could not answer, for he was going out
from Jerusalem for hundreds of miles into the sun and
the thirst of the desert, to the land of the fiercest Arabs&mdash;Moslems
whose religion tells them that they must kill
the infidel Christians. It was difficult to tear himself
from his wife and his children and go out to face death
in the desert. But he had come out here to carry to the
Arab the story of Jesus Christ, who Himself had died
on a Cross outside this very city.</p>

<p><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>So he kissed his little boy "good-bye," wrenched
himself away, climbed on top of the load on one of
the pack horses and rode out through the gate into the
unknown. He thought as his horses picked their way
down the road from Jerusalem toward Jericho of how
Jesus Christ had been put to death in this very land.
Over his left shoulder he saw the slopes of the Mount
of Olives; down below across the ravine on his right
was the Garden of Gethsemane. In a short time he was
passing through Bethany where Mary and Martha
lived. Down the steep winding road amongst the rocks
he went, and took a cup of cold water at the inn of the
Good Samaritan.</p>

<p>Then with the Wilderness of Desolation stretching
its tawny tumbled desert hills away to the left, he moved
onward, down and down until the road came out a
thousand feet below sea-level among the huts and sheepfolds
of Jericho, where he slept that night.</p>

<p>With his face toward the dawn that came up over the
hills of Moab in the distance, he was off again over the
plain with the Dead Sea on his right, across the swiftly
flowing Jordan, and climbing the ravines that lead into
the mountains of Gilead.</p>

<p>That night he stayed with a Circassian family in a
little house of only one room into which were crowded
his two horses, a mule, two donkeys, a yoke of oxen,
some sheep and goats, a crowd of cocks and hens, four
small dirty children and their father and mother; and
a great multitude of fleas.</p>

<p>The mother fried him a supper of eggs with bread,
and after it he showed them something that they had
never seen before. He took out of his pack a copy of
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>the New Testament translated into Arabic.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> He read
bits out of it and talked to them about the Love of God.</p>

<p>Early next morning, his saddle-bag stuffed with a
batch of loaves which the woman had baked first thing
in the morning specially for him, he set out again.</p>

<p>How could a whole batch of loaves be stuffed in one
saddle-bag? The loaves are flat and circular like a
pancake. The dough is spread on a kind of cushion, the
woman takes up the cushion with the dough on it,
pushes it through the opening and slaps the dough on
the inner wall of a big mud oven (out of doors) that
has been heated with a fire of twigs, and in a minute
or two pushes the cushion in again and the cooked
bread falls on to it.</p>

<p>So Forder climbed up the mountain track till he came
out on the high plain. He saw the desert in front of
him&mdash;like a vast rolling ocean of glowing gold it
stretched away and away for close on a thousand miles
eastward to the Persian Gulf. Forder knew that only
here and there in all those blazing, sandy wastes were
oases where men could build their houses round some
well or little stream that soon lost itself in the sand.
All the rest was desert across which man and beast
must hurry or die of thirst. He must follow the camel-tracks
from oasis to oasis, where they could find a well
of water, therefore drink for man and camel, and date-palms.</p>

<p>So turning north he pressed on<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> till on the sixth day
out from Jerusalem the clouds came up with the dawn,
and hail and rain, carried by a biting east wind, beat
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>down upon him. Lifting his eyes to the horizon he saw
ahead the sturdy castle and thick walls of the ancient
city of Bosra. Stumbling through the storm, along the
narrow winding streets, he met, to his disgust, a man
whose dress showed that he was a Turkish Government
official. He knew that the Turkish Government would
be against a Christian and a foreigner going into their
land.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the official, stopping him.
"Where are you from? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>Forder told him, and the man said. "Come with me.
I will find you and your horses shelter at the Governor's
house." Forder followed him into a large room in the
middle of which on the floor a fire was burning.</p>

<p>"I must examine all your cases," said the official.
"Get up. Open your boxes."</p>

<p>"Never," said Forder. "This is not a custom-house."</p>

<p>"Your boxes are full of powder for arming the Arabs
against the Turkish Government," replied the official.</p>

<p>"I will not open them," said Forder, "unless you
bring me written orders from the Turkish Governor in
Damascus and from the British Consul."</p>

<p>Off went the official to consult the headman (the
equivalent of the Mayor) of the city. The headman
came and asked many questions. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Well, my orders are to turn back all Europeans and
not to let any stay in these parts. However, as you
seem to be almost an Arab, may God go with you and
give you peace."</p>

<p>So Forder and the headman of the ancient city of
Bosra got talking together. Forder opened his satchel
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>and drew out an Arabic New Testament, and together
they read parts of the story of the life of Jesus Christ
and talked about Him till ten o'clock at night. As the
headman rose to go to his own rooms Forder offered
to him, and he gladly took, the copy of the New Testament
in Arabic to read for himself.</p>


<p><i>Saved by the Mist</i></p>

<p>Next morning early, Forder had his horses loaded
and started off with his face to the dawn. The track
now led toward the great Castle of Sulkhund, which
he saw looming up on the horizon twenty-five miles
away, against the dull sky. But mist came down; wind,
rain, and hail buffeted him; the horses, to escape the
hail in their faces, turned aside, and the trail was lost.
Mist hid everything. Forder's compass showed that he
was going south; so he turned east again; but he could
not strike the narrow, broken, stony trail.</p>

<p>Suddenly smoke could be seen, and then a hamlet of
thirty houses loomed up. Forder opened a door and a
voice came calling, "Welcome!" He went in and saw
some Arabs crouching there out of the rain. A fire of
dried manure was made; the smoke made Forder's eyes
smart and the tears run down his cheeks. He changed
into another man's clothes, and hung his own up in the
smoke to dry.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" he asked. The men told him that
he was about two and a half hours' ride from the castle
and two hours off the track that he had left in the mist.
The men came in from the other little houses to see the
stranger and sip coffee. Forder again brought out an
Arabic New Testament and found to his surprise that
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>some of the men could read quite well and were very
keen on his books. So they bought some of the Bibles
from him. They had no money but paid him in dried
figs, flour and eggs. At last they left him to curl up
on the hard floor; and in spite of the cold and draughts
and the many fleas he soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>As dawn came up he rose and started off: there (as
he climbed out of the hollow in which the hamlet lay)
he could see the Castle Sulkhund. He knew that the
Turks did not want any foreigner to enter that land of
the Arabs, and that if he were seen, he would certainly
be ordered back. Yet he could not hide, for the path
ran close under the castle, and on the wall strode the
sentry. The plain was open; there was no way by
which he could creep past.</p>

<p>At last he came to the hill on which the castle stood.
At that very moment a dense mist came down; he
walked along, lost the track, and found it again. Then
there came a challenge from the sentry. He could not
see the sentry or the sentry him. So he called back in
Arabic that he was a friend, and so passed on in the
mist. At last he was out on the open ground beyond
both the castle and the little town by it. Five minutes
later the mist blew away; the sun shone; the castle was
passed, and the open plains lay before him. The mist
had saved him.</p>

<p>In an hour he came to a large town named Orman on
the edge of the desert sandy plains; and here he stayed
for some weeks. His horses were sent back to Jerusalem.
Instead of towns and villages of huts, he would
now find only the tents of wandering Arabs who had to
keep moving to find bits of sparse growth for their few
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>sheep and camels. While he was at Orman he managed
to make friends with many of the Arabs and with
their Chief. He asked the Chief to help him on toward
Kaf&mdash;an oasis town across the desert.</p>

<p>"Don't go," the Chief and his people said, "the Arabs
there are bad: when we go we never let our rifles out of
our hands."</p>

<p>So the old Chief told him of the dangers of the desert;
death from thirst or from the fiery Arabs of Kaf.</p>

<p>"I am trusting God to protect and keep me," said
Forder. "I believe He will do so."</p>

<p>So Forder handed the Chief most of his money to
take care of, and sewed up the rest into the waistband
of his trousers. (It is as safe as a bank to hand your
money to an Arab chief who has entertained you in his
tent. If you have "eaten his salt" he will not betray or
rob you. Absolute loyalty to your guest is the unwritten
law that no true Arab ever breaks.)</p>


<p><i>The Caravan of Two Thousand Camels</i></p>

<p>At last the old Chief very unwillingly called a man,
told him to get a camel, load up Forder's things on it,
and pass him on to the first Arab tent that he found.
Two days passed before they found a group of Bedouin
tents. He was allowed to sleep in a tent: but early
in the morning he woke with a jump. The whole of the
tent had fallen right on him; he crawled out. He saw
the Arab women standing round; they had pulled the
tent down.</p>

<p>"Why do you do this so early?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The men," they replied, "have ordered us to move
to another place; they fear to give shelter to a Christian
&mdash;<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>one that is unclean and would cause trouble to come
on us."</p>

<p>So the tribesmen with their women and flocks made
off, leaving Forder, his guide, and the camel alone in the
desert. That afternoon he found a tent and heard that
a great caravan was expected to pass that night on the
way to Kaf to get salt. Night fell; it was a full moon.
Forder sat with the others in the tent doorway round
the fire. A man ran up to them.</p>

<p>"I hear the bells of the camels," he said. Quickly
Forder's goods were loaded on a camel. He jumped on
top. He was led off into the open plain. Away across
the desert clear in the moonlight came the dark mass of
the caravan with the tinkle of innumerable bells.</p>

<p>Arabs galloped ahead of the caravan. They drew up
their horses shouting, "Who are you? What do you
want?" Then came fifty horsemen with long spears in
their hands, rifles slung from their shoulders, swords
hanging from their belts, and revolvers stuck in their
robes. They were guarding the first section made up
of four hundred camels. There were four sections,
each guarded by fifty warriors.</p>

<p>As they passed, the man with Forder shouted out the
names of friends of his who&mdash;he thought&mdash;would be in
the caravan. Sixteen hundred camels passed in the
moonlight, but still no answer came. Then the last section
began to pass. The cry went up again of the
names of the men. At last an answering shout was
heard. The men they sought were found. Forder's
guide explained who he was and that he wanted to go
to Kaf. His baggage was swiftly shifted onto another
camel, and in a few minutes he had mounted, and his
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>camel was swinging along with two thousand others
into the east.</p>

<p>For hour after hour the tireless camels swung on and
on, tawny beasts on a tawny desert, under a silver moon
that swam in a deep indigo sky in which a million stars
sparkled. The moon slowly sank behind them; ahead
the first flush of pink lighted the sky; but still they
pushed on. At last at half-past six in the morning they
stopped. Forder flung himself on the sand wrapped in
his <i>abba</i> (his Arab cloak) and in a few seconds was
asleep. In fifteen minutes, however, they awakened
him. Already most of the camels had moved on. From
dawn till noon, from noon under the blazing sun till
half-past five in the afternoon, the camels moved on
and on, "unhasting, unresting." As the camels were
kneeling to be unloaded, a shout went up. Forder looking
up saw ten robbers on horseback on a mound. Like
the wind the caravan warriors galloped after them
firing rapidly, and at last captured them and dragged
them back to the camp.</p>

<p>"Start again," the command went round, and in
fifteen minutes the two thousand camels swung grumbling
and groaning out on the endless trail of the desert.
The captured Arabs were marched in the centre. All
through the night the caravan went on from moonrise
to moonset, and through the morning from dawn till
ten o'clock&mdash;for they dared not rest while the tribe from
whom they had captured the prisoners could get near
them. Then they released the captives and sent them
back, for on the horizon they saw the green palms of
Kaf, the city that they sought.</p>

<p>The camels had only rested for thirty minutes in
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>forty hours.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> With grunts of pleasure they dropped on
their knees and were freed from their loads, and began
hungrily to eat their food.</p>

<p>Forder leapt down and was so glad to be in Kaf that
he ran into some palm gardens close by and sang
"Praise God from Whom all blessings flow," jumped
for joy, and then washed all the sweat and sand from
himself in a hot spring of sulphur water.</p>

<p>Lying down on the floor of a little house to which
he was shown, he slept, with his head on his saddlebags,
all day till nearly sunset.</p>

<p>At sunset a gun was fired. The caravan was starting
on its return journey. Forder's companions on the
caravan came to him.</p>

<p>"Come back with us," they said. "Why will you
stay with these cursed people of Kaf? They will surely
kill you because you are a Christian."</p>

<p>It was hard to stay. But no Christian white man had
ever been in that land before carrying the Good News
of Jesus, and Forder had come out to risk his life for
that very purpose. So he stayed.</p>

<p>What made Forder put his life in peril and stand the
heat, vermin, and hate? Why try to make friends with
these wild bandits? Why care about them at all? He
was a baker in his own country in England and might
have gone on with this work. It was the love of Christ
that gave him the love of all men, and, in obeying His
command to "Go into all the world," he found adventure,
made friends, and left with them the Good News
in the New Testament.</p>

<h4>THE FRIEND OF THE ARAB</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Archibald Forder</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Date of Incident, 1901)</p>


<p><i>The Lone Trail of Friendship</i></p>

<p>So the two thousand camels swung out on the homeward
trail. Forder now was alone in Kaf.</p>

<p>"Never," he says, "shall I forget the feeling of loneliness
that came over me as I made my way back to my
room. The thought that I was the only Christian in
the whole district was one that I cannot well describe."</p>

<p>As Forder passed a group of Arabs he heard them
muttering to one another, "<i>Nisraney</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>&mdash;one of the
cursed ones&mdash;the enemy of Allah!" He remembered
that he had been warned that the Arabs of Kaf were
fierce, bigoted Moslems who would slay a Christian at
sight. But he put on a brave front and went to the
Chief's house. There he sat down with the men on the
ground and began to eat with them from a great iron
pot a hot, slimy, greasy savoury, and then sipped coffee
with them.</p>

<p>"Why have you come here?" they asked him.</p>

<p>"My desire is," he replied, "to pass on to the Jowf."</p>

<p><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>Now the Jowf is the largest town in the Syrian desert&mdash;the
most important in all Northern Arabia. From
there camel caravans go north, south, east, and west.
Forder could see how his Arabic New Testaments
would be carried from that city to all the camel tracks
of Arabia.</p>

<p>"The Jowf is eleven days' camel ride away there,"
they said, pointing to the south-east.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/272.png"><img width="100%" src="images/272.png" alt="FORDER'S JOURNEY TO THE JOWF." title="FORDER'S JOURNEY TO THE JOWF." /></a></div>

<p>"Go back to Orman," said the Chief, whose name
was Mohammed-el-Bady, "it is at your peril that you
go forward."</p>

<p>He sent a servant to bring in the headman of his
caravan. "This <i>Nisraney</i> wishes to go with the caravan
to the Jowf," said the Chief. "What do you think
of it?"</p>

<p>"If I took a Christian to the Jowf," replied the caravan
leader, "I am afraid Johar the Chief there would
kill me for doing such a thing. I cannot do it."</p>

<p>"Yes," another said, turning to Forder, "if you ever
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>want to see the Jowf you must turn Moslem, as no
Christian would be allowed to live there many days."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Chief, closing the discussion, "I will
see more about this to-morrow."</p>

<p>As the men sat smoking round the fire Forder pulled
a book out from his pouch. They watched him curiously.</p>

<p>"Can any of you read?" he asked. There were a
number who could; so Forder opened the book&mdash;which
was an Arabic New Testament&mdash;at St. John's Gospel,
Chapter III.</p>

<p>"Will you read?" he asked.</p>

<p>So the Arab read in his own language this chapter.
As we read the chapter through ourselves it is interesting
to wonder which of the verses would be most easily
understood by the Arabs. When the Arab who was
reading came to the words:</p>

<p>"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not
perish, but have everlasting life," Forder talked to them
telling what the words meant. They listened very
closely and asked many questions. It was all quite new
to them.</p>

<p>"Will you give me the book?" asked the Arab who
was reading. Forder knew that he would only value it
if he bought it, so he sold it to him for some dates, and
eight or nine men bought copies from him.</p>

<p>Next day the Chief tried to get other passing Arabs
to conduct Forder to the Jowf, but none would take the
risk. So at last he lent him two of his own servants to
lead him to Ithera&mdash;an oasis four hours' camel ride
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>across the desert. So away they went across the desert
and in the late afternoon saw the palms of Ithera.</p>

<p>"We have brought you a Christian," shouted the
servants as they led Forder into a room full of men, and
dumped his goods down on the floor. "We stick him on
to you; do what you can with him."</p>

<p>"This is neither a Christian, nor a Jew, nor an infidel,"
shouted one of the men, "but a pig." He did not
know that Forder understood Arabic.</p>

<p>"Men," he replied boldly, "I am neither pig, infidel,
nor Jew. I am a Christian, one that worships God, the
same God as you do."</p>

<p>"If you are a Christian," exclaimed the old Chief,
"go and sit among the cattle!" So Forder went to the
further end of the room and sat between an old white
mare and a camel.</p>

<p>Soon a man came in, and walking over to Forder put
his hand out and shook his. He sat down by him and,
talking very quietly so that the others should not hear,
said: "Who are you, and from where do you come?"</p>

<p>"From Jerusalem," said Forder. "I am a Christian
preacher."</p>

<p>"If you value your life," went on the stranger, "you
will get out of this as quickly as you can, or the men,
who are a bad lot, will kill you. I am a Druze<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> but I
pretend to be a Moslem."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is the Chief of Ithera?" asked
Forder.</p>

<p>"Very kind," was the reply. So the friendly stranger
went out. Forder listened carefully to the talk.</p>

<p><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>"Let us cut his throat while he is asleep," said one
man.</p>

<p>"No," said the Chief. "I will not have the blood
of a Christian on my house and town."</p>

<p>"Let us poison his supper," said another. But the
Chief would not agree.</p>

<p>"Drive him out into the desert to die of hunger and
thirst," suggested a third. "No," said the Chief, whose
name was Khy-Khevan, "we will leave him till the
morning."</p>

<p>Forder was then called to share supper with the
others, and afterwards the Chief led him out to the
palm gardens, so that his evil influence should not make
the beasts ill; half an hour later, fearing he would spoil
the date-harvest by his presence, the Chief led him to
a filthy tent where an old man lay with a disease so
horrible that they had thrust him out of the village to
die.</p>

<p>The next day Forder found that later in the week the
old Chief himself was going to the Jowf. Ripping open
the waistband of his trousers, Forder took out four
French Napoleons (gold coins worth 16s. each) and
went off to the Chief, whom he found alone in his guest
room.</p>

<p>Walking up to him Forder held out the money saying,
"If you will let me go to the Jowf with you, find
me camel, water and food, I will give you these four
pieces."</p>

<p>"Give them to me now," said Khy-Khevan, "and we
will start after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No," replied Forder, "you come outside, and before
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>the men of the place I will give them to you; they must
be witnesses." So in the presence of the men the bargain
was made.</p>

<p>In the morning the camels were got together&mdash;about
a hundred and twenty of them&mdash;with eighty men, some
of whom came round Forder, and patting their daggers
and guns said, "These things are for using on Christians.
We shall leave your dead body in the sand if
you do not change your religion and be a follower of
Mohammed."</p>

<p>After these cheerful encouragements the caravan
started at one o'clock. For four hours they travelled.
Then a shout went up&mdash;"Look behind!"</p>

<p>Looking round Forder saw a wild troop of Bedouin
robbers galloping after them as hard as they could ride.
The camels were rushed together in a group: the men
of Ithera fired on the robbers and went after them.
After a short, sharp battle the robbers made off and the
men settled down where they were for the night, during
which they had to beat off another attack by the
robbers.</p>

<p>Forder said, "What brave fellows you are!" This
praise pleased them immensely, and they began to be
friendly with him, and forgot that they had meant to
leave his dead body in the desert, though they still told
him he would be killed at the Jowf. For three days
they travelled on without finding any water, and even
on the fourth day they only found it by digging up the
sand with their fingers till they had made a hole over
six feet deep where they found some.</p>

<p><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><i>In the Heart of the Desert</i></p>

<p>At last Forder saw the great mass of the old castle,
"no one knows how old," that guards the Jowf<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that
great isolated city with its thousands of lovely green
date palms in the heart of the tremendous ocean of
desert.</p>

<p>Men, women and children came pouring out to meet
their friends: for a desert city is like a port to which the
wilderness is the ocean, and the caravan of camels is
the ship, and the friends go down as men do to the harbour
to meet friends from across the sea.</p>

<p>"May Allah curse him!" they cried, scowling, when
they heard that a Christian stranger was in the caravan.
"The enemy of Allah and the prophet! Unclean! Infidel!"</p>

<p>Johar, the great Chief of the Jowf, commanded that
Forder should be brought into his presence, and proceeded
to question him:</p>

<p>"Did you come over here alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"Were you not afraid?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied.</p>

<p>"Have you no fear of anyone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I fear God and the devil."</p>

<p>"Do you not fear me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But I could cut your head off."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Forder, "I know you could. But
you wouldn't treat a guest thus."</p>

<p>"You must become a follower of Mohammed," said<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>
Johar, "for we are taught to kill Christians. Say to
me, 'There is no God but God and Mohammed is His
prophet' and I will give you wives and camels and a
house and palms." Everybody sat listening for the
answer. Forder paused and prayed in silence for a few
seconds, for he knew that on his answer life or death
would depend.</p>

<p>"Chief Johar," said Forder, "if you were in the land
of the Christians, the guest of the monarch, and if the
ruler asked you to become a Christian and give up your
religion would you do it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Johar proudly, "not if the ruler had my
head cut off."</p>

<p>"Secondly," he said to Johar, "which do you think
it best to do, to please God or to please man?"</p>

<p>"To please God," said the Chief.</p>

<p>"Johar," said Forder, "I am just like you; I cannot
change my religion, not if you cut off two heads; and I
must please God by remaining a Christian.... I cannot
do what you ask me. It is impossible." Johar rose
up and went out much displeased.</p>


<p><i>"Kill the Christian!"</i></p>

<p>One day soon after this there was fierce anger because
the mud tower in which Johar was sitting fell in,
and Johar was covered with the debris. "This is the
Christian's doing," someone cried. "He looked at the
tower and bewitched it, so it has fallen." At once the
cry was raised, "Kill the Christian&mdash;kill him&mdash;kill
him! The Christian! The Christian!"</p>

<p>An angry mob dashed toward Forder with clubs,
daggers and revolvers. He stood still awaiting them.<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>
They were within eighty yards when, to his own amazement,
three men came from behind him, and standing
in front of Forder between him and his assailants pulled
out their revolvers and shouted, "Not one of you come
near this Christian!" The murderous crowd halted.
Forder slowly walked backwards toward his room, his
defenders doing the same, and the crowd melted away.</p>

<p>He then turned to his three defenders and said,
"What made you come to defend me as you did?"</p>

<p>"We have been to India," they answered, "and we
have seen the Christians there, and we know that they
do no harm to any man. We have also seen the effect
of the rule of you English in that land and in Egypt,
and we will always help Christians when we can. We
wish the English would come here; Christians are better
than Moslems."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Other adventures came to Forder in the Jowf, and he
read the New Testament with some of the men who
bought the books from him to read. At last Khy-Khevan,
the Chief of Ithera, who had brought Forder
to the Jowf, said that he must go back, and Forder,
who had now learned what he wished about the Jowf,
and had put the books of the Gospel into the hands of
the men, decided to return to his wife and boys in
Jerusalem to prepare to bring them over to live with
him in that land of the Arabs. So he said farewell to
the Chief Johar, and rode away on a camel with Khy-Khevan.
Many things he suffered&mdash;from fever and
hunger, from heat and thirst, and vermin. But at last
he reached Jerusalem once more; and his little four-year-old
boy clapped hands with joy as he saw his
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>father come back after those long months of peril and
hardship.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred miles he had ridden on horse and
camel, or walked. Two hundred and fifty Arabic Gospels
and Psalms had been sold to people who had never
seen them before. Hundreds of men and women had
heard him tell them of the love of Jesus. And friends
had been made among Arabs all over those desert
tracks, to whom he could go back again in the days that
were to come. The Arabs of the Syrian Desert all think
of Archibald Forder to-day as their friend and listen to
him because he has proved to them that he wishes them
well.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
